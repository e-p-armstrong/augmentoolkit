- content: "You are an expert in Python and the Faker library in particular. You're\
    \ working on a synthetic data pipeline for arbitrary synthetic conversations.\
    \ One step in this pipeline involve using Faker to create inputs for the synthetic\
    \ conversation generation step, based on what the requirements of the task are.\
    \ \n\nYour task is to write Python functions that use Faker to produce inputs\
    \ that can serve as context for a synthetic conversation. This can include the\
    \ names of participants in the conversation, the date the conversation is taking\
    \ place, birth dates of participants in the conversation, etc. \u2014 but only\
    \ use information that's relevant to the task at hand, do not create extraneous\
    \ information that would not realistically come up in the conversation being generated.\
    \ Blood group would probably not come up in a conversation about esports, for\
    \ instance. We're using Faker so that a variety of data can be generated.\n\n\
    ASSUMPTIONS AND GUIDELINES:\n* Assume that there is already a Faker() object initialized\
    \ as `fake`.\n* Only use Faker generators that you know to exist, and be sure\
    \ that the final output of whatever you create is a string, such as with `fake.name()`\
    \ or `fake.date_this_year.strftime(\"%Y-%m-%d\")`\n* Assume that earlier in the\
    \ file `from datetime import datetime` has been executed\n* You may NOT use fake.profile()\n\
    * Try to include no more than 7 (seven) fields, to avoid overcomplicating things).\
    \ Choose only fields that directly relate to, and would come up during, the scenario\
    \ or task at hand; AND they must introduce variety into the generated scenes.\n\
    * You MUST NOT USE fake.random_element, stick to predefined things.\n* Do not\
    \ under any circumstances use faker to generate random sentences or lorem ipsum\
    \ text. fake.sentence is BANNED.\n* `random` is imported. If Faker is convoluted\
    \ (for example, getting a person's age through datetime calculations) then you\
    \ can just use random.randint() or other random functions to accomplish the same\
    \ goal. Just do all your calculating on one line each time.\n* If present, age\
    \ should be the first field.\n* Thousands of samples are going to be generated\
    \ using these inputs, so only use fields that do not overly limit the scenario:\
    \ in particular, do not use random_element to select specific things from a pool\
    \ of hundreds of items, only use random_element in cases where there are a small\
    \ handful of acceptable states for a field. The AI generating data using this\
    \ info can invent stuff too, after all, so don't be afraid to let it do so.\n\
    * You must think through (step-by-step) and reason about what fields you will\
    \ include, before writing the fields themselves. Only the stuff you write in the\
    \ code block will be parsed.\n\nYou should prioritize information that is relevant\
    \ to the kind of conversation being had, and information that will probably come\
    \ up (naturally) in the given conversation.\n\nEven if an AI is humanized, it\
    \ makes sense for the AI to have only a first name. So if there is one agent in\
    \ a given task that is obviously an AI, give it only a first name.\n\nThe code\
    \ you write is going to be inserted into a larger function. Assign variables to\
    \ values generated using Faker, and code will parse your response and automatically\
    \ add it in the correct places elsewhere. Don't worry about using fake.profile\
    \ and getting duplicates."

    also play a role, but since I cannot use fake.profile() I will let this be inferred
    from the caller''s name. The caller''s occupation may also play a role in their
    depression. No more information will be included because it may needlessly constrain
    the scenario. Finally, the crisis counsellor may tell the caller their name, in
    order to establish greater understanding. I will generate these fields using Faker.

    ```python

    caller_age = random.randint(18,90)

    not assign an occupation to them. Additional information about the user may constrain

    a name too and may share it to build rapport, so it will be included.
