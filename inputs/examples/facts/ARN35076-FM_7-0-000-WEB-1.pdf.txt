FM 7-0 TRAINING JUNE 2021 DISTRIBUTION RESTRICTION: Approved for public release; distribution is unlimited. This publication supersedes FM 7-0, dated 5 October 2016. HEADQUARTERS, DEPARTMENT OF THE ARMY Foreword Winning matters! There is no second place or honorable mention in combat. We win by developing cohesive teams that are highly trained, disciplined, and fit. We win by doing the right things the right way. We win through our people. FM 7-0, Training, describes how the Army trains our people to compete, fight, and win, because the best fighting forces in the world ensure their small units and individuals are masters of their craft. The operational environment has evolved, we must reenergize our training efforts to be able to compete with, and if called upon, defeat near-peer adversaries through large-scale combat operations as part of the Joint Force. Our training must be highly focused and designed to deliver units that are well trained and confident in their abilities to fight and win anywhere, against any enemy. Our training will develop trust and confidence in our doctrine, our equipment, our leaders, our teammates, and ourselves. Our training programs must generate demonstrated tactical and technical competence, confidence, and initiative in our Soldiers and their leaders. Commanders are the primary trainers. Commanders set the standard and provide guidance, direction, and purpose. They link unit training to winning in competition, crisis, and conflict. Noncommissioned officers enforce these standards and provide their commanders with timely, accurate, and candid feedback. They do this through direct leadership by linking Soldier and crew training performance to unit collective training. Working together, commanders and NCOs ensure that Soldiers, crews, small teams, and units achieve mastery of their craft. I expect leaders in all organizations, at every echelon, to know, understand, and apply the concepts in this manual. People First, Winning Matters, Army Strong! MICHAEL A.

This publication applies to all Army leaders and the three components of the Total Army: the Regular Army, the Army National Guard, and the Army Reserve. This publication focuses on training leaders and Soldiers as effectively and efficiently as possible given limitations in time and resources. FM 7-0 guides leaders to develop realistic and challenging training, which includes changing conditions and various environments when required. FM 7-0 contains five chapters: Chapter 1 discusses the importance of training and the criteria for measuring unit training proficiency. It presents the Army’s principles of training from ADP 7-0, explaining why they are foundational to everything leaders do in training. It discusses the unique responsibilities of senior leaders in training. The chapter closes with an introduction to the Army’s training management cycle, which is also the framework of FM 7-0. Chapter 2 introduces the concept of prioritizing mission-essential tasks, weapons qualification, and collective live-fire tasks. It includes a discussion of battle tasks and how they link prioritized mission- essential tasks to the prioritized collective tasks trained below the company level. It also discusses how battle tasks link to the prioritized individual tasks Soldiers train. Chapter 3 provides an overview of the training planning process. It discusses ways commanders establish a battle rhythm for training. Then it details the planning and preparation for long-range, mid-range and short- range planning. Chapter 4 gives an overview of how units execute training. It first discusses the role of leaders in execution. It continues with ways the chain of command present and perform training. This chapter continues with discussions on live-fire training, simulations, and training techniques. The chapter concludes with discussions on after action reviews and recording results of training. Chapter 5 discusses training evaluations and assessments. It delineates between evaluations based on approved standards, and the assessments commanders render. FM 7-0 contains eleven appendixes. Each appendix significantly expands on the procedures introduced in the chapters. See the introductory table for new and modified terms. Introductory table.

McConville OVERVIEW 1-1. The Army trains to fight and win—it is what we do in order to preserve the peace and to decisively defeat our enemies. We do this through challenging, relevant, and realistic training performed to the highest standards. The Army trains the way it operates. It does this by replicating in training how we expect to fight, closing the gap between operations and training. This manual is about how we train to win. TRAINING PROFICIENCY 1-2. Units train to three proficiencies:  Mission-essential task proficiency is achieved by the unit’s ability to perform mission-essential task training to standard; in multiple complex and dynamic operational environments, with external evaluation while accomplishing the appropriate Soldier, unit and leader tasks as outlined in training and evaluation outlines. (See appendix D for training and evaluation outlines.)  Weapons qualification. Weapons qualification involves individual, crew-served, and platform- weapons proficiency. The unit achieves weapons qualification by qualifying on all its organic weapons under all conditions as specified by applicable weapon system publications.  Collective live-fire task proficiency. Collective live-fire task proficiency is achieved by the unit executing specified collective tasks while employing its organic weapons systems in a live-fire environment. 1-3. The unit is trained when it achieves the proficiencies specified by the commander. 1-4. Collective task proficiency is rated as—  Trained: T (Advanced Task Proficiency). A Trained proficiency rating means a unit is trained. It has attained advanced task proficiency free of significant shortcomings. The unit’s shortcomings require minimal training to meet the Army standard.  Practiced: P (Basic Task Proficiency). A Practiced proficiency rating means a unit is practiced. It has attained basic task proficiency with shortcomings. The unit’s shortcomings may require significant training to meet the Army standard.  Untrained: U (Cannot Perform Task). An Untrained proficiency rating means a unit is untrained. The unit cannot perform the task. The unit requires complete training on the task to achieve the Army standard. PRINCIPLES OF TRAINING 1-5. The principles of training provide foundational direction for all commanders and leaders. These principles guide and influence training at every echelon. The following principles of training complement each other, providing task and purpose to every aspect of how Army forces train:  Commanders are the primary trainers.  Noncommissioned officers train individuals, crews, and small teams; advise commanders on all aspects of training. Chapter 1 1-2 FM 7-0 14 June 2021  Train using multiechelon techniques to maximize time and resource efficiency.  Train as a combined arms team.  Train to standard using appropriate doctrine.  Train as you fight.  Sustain levels of training proficiency over time.  Train to maintain.  Fight to train. COMMANDERS ARE THE PRIMARY TRAINERS 1-6. Commanders and leaders at echelon are responsible and accountable for the training and performance of their units. Commanders train and resource training one echelon down, and they evaluate to two echelons down. They are responsible for assessing unit training proficiency and prioritizing unit training. Subordinate unit leaders are the primary trainers of their elements. For example, a platoon leader is responsible for the training and performance of the platoon. NONCOMMISSIONED OFFICERS TRAIN INDIVIDUALS, CREWS, AND SMALL TEAMS; ADVISE COMMANDERS ON ALL ASPECTS OF TRAINING 1-7. Noncommissioned officers set the foundation for Army training. They train Soldiers, crews, and small teams to be battle-ready. They provide crucial input and advice to the commander on what is trained and how it is trained. This ensures the organization trains on its most important tasks down to the individual Soldier. Noncommissioned officers—  Maintain responsibility for Soldier and small-unit training proficiency.  Identify and train Soldier, crew, and small-team tasks.  Help identify and prioritize unit collective tasks that support unit mission-essential tasks.  Train and enforce task standards.  Continually focus training on sustaining strengths and improving weaknesses.  Develop junior noncommissioned officers and help officers develop junior officers.  Provide timely and objective training advice to their officers.  Assist in planning, resource coordination, support, risk mitigation, supervision, and evaluation of training. TRAIN USING MULTIECHELON TECHNIQUES TO MAXIMIZE TIME AND RESOURCE EFFICIENCY 1-8. The Army fights as a team, and whenever possible, trains at echelon as a team. Additionally, the simultaneous training of multiple echelons on complementary tasks is the most efficient and effective way to train because it optimizes the use of time and resources. TRAIN AS A COMBINED ARMS TEAM 1-9. The Army fights as a combined arms team. To win, units must regularly train with the organizations they operate, and the capabilities with which they intend to fight. Leaders must proactively plan and coordinate training to account for as many elements and domains as possible with which they will operate. TRAIN TO STANDARD USING APPROPRIATE DOCTRINE 1-10. The Army trains to standard using appropriate doctrinal publications. A standard is the proficiency required to accomplish a task under a specified set of conditions that reflect the dynamic complexities of operational environments to include cyber, electronic warfare, and hybrid threats. Units training to achieve task proficiency should use a regionally based, decisive action training environment (for example, Europe, the Pacific, Africa, or the Caucuses). Leaders continue to train high priority tasks even after units achieve Training Management 14 June 2021 FM 7-0 1-3 standards. They do this by increasing the complexity of task conditions, the levels of stress and by maximizing repetitions and sets until task mastery is achieved. TRAIN AS YOU FIGHT 1-11. Leaders create training environments as close to combat-like conditions as possible. Such training environments include opposing forces (known as OPFOR) that replicate tough, realistic, and relevant near- peer threats in a variety of operational variables so Soldiers and units train to overcome the stress, chaos, uncertainty, and complexity of combat. SUSTAIN LEVELS OF TRAINING PROFICIENCY OVER TIME 1-12. In training, commanders not only strive to reach training proficiency, but also seek to sustain levels of proficiency over time. Leaders understand the impact of task atrophy—that over time and circumstances, individual and unit skills naturally erode. Leaders actively and aggressively work to mitigate the effects of task atrophy by using available training resources to extend training proficiency when possible. Effectively leveraging live, virtual, and constructive environments assists leaders in sustaining training proficiency and enabling task mastery. Virtual training sets conditions for live training by allowing for unlimited task repetitions during the preparation phase of a training event and continued repetitions after execution helps sustain proficiency over time. Commanders are expected to sustain designated proficiency levels for mission- essential tasks, weapons qualification, and collective live-fire tasks within a ‘band of excellence.’ (See figure 1-1 for the band of excellence.) While commanders recognize the effects of task atrophy on unit training skills, they continuously mitigate the effects of task atrophy to sustain proficiencies over time. Figure 1-1. Sustaining unit training proficiency within a band of excellence TRAIN TO MAINTAIN 1-13. Units train to maintain to keep personnel, equipment, and systems in the fight. Leaders ensure units conduct maintenance under all conditions to sustain effective combat power over time and significant distances. Chapter 1 1-4 FM 7-0 14 June 2021 1-14. To keep personnel in the fight and in line with the Army’s Action Plan to Prioritize People and Teams, leaders must foster a culture of holistic health and fitness (known as H2F) by understanding the system, trusting the system, and dedicating the time to make it work. (See FM 7-22 for more information on holistic health and fitness.) 1-15. Units train to a level that is sustainable. As the unit progresses toward training proficiency, leaders must ensure there is adequate recovery, services, and maintenance operations to replenish Soldiers, equipment, and systems. This must be done prior to and while the unit executes its long-range training plan in order to achieve and sustain required training proficiencies. FIGHT TO TRAIN 1-16. It is a commander’s duty to fight through distractions and protect training. It is the higher echelon commander’s responsibility to defend their subordinate organization’s approved training from un-forecasted requirements and to underwrite associated risk to lower priority missions. Regardless of the quality of planning and preparation, there will be challenges to the execution of training. The fight to train ethic separates great trainers and units from the others. SENIOR LEADERS AND TRAINING 1-17. Training is an essential activity that requires senior leader direct involvement. Commanders and senior leaders are critical to ensuring training is effective. They focus unit training efforts through their leadership, presence, and effective communication and refinement of their training priorities. 1-18. Senior leaders develop and communicate training guidance quarterly, semi-annually, and annually. Reserve Component senior leaders communicate training guidance annually. Over a set period, they provide clear and concise guidance on what is trained, when it is trained, who is trained, and why they train —task and purpose. Senior leaders provide a clear vision of their training expectations giving the unit direction, purpose, and motivation necessary to train effectively. (See appendix A for training guidance.) 1-19. This guidance and vision is based on a comprehensive understanding of the following considerations:  Require subordinates to understand and perform their roles in training. Through direct leader involvement and presence, senior leaders teach subordinates how to fight and are directly involved in planning, execution, and assessment of training.  Train one echelon down, evaluate two echelons down. Senior commanders are responsible for training the next echelon down. They evaluate unit training proficiency two echelons down. Senior commanders ensure subordinate commanders do the same at their respective echelon.  Resource and protect approved training. When training is approved, it is resourced and protected from un-forecasted and non-mission-essential requirements that detract from training. Approved and protected training provides predictable training schedules for junior leaders and Soldiers.  Develop subordinates. Senior leaders develop subordinates. Senior leaders train leaders to plan carefully, execute aggressively, and evaluate short-term achievements in terms of required long- term results. They personally invest in the development of subordinate leaders through focused leader development activities and performance-oriented counseling.  Train to standard. The Army of the United States is a standards-based Army. Senior leaders and noncommissioned officers make sure training is conducted to the prescribed standard by ensuring leaders are trained, competent, and certified, and hold their organizations to the standard.  Top-down, bottom-up approach to training. A top-down, bottom-up approach to training reflects a team effort among commanders and subordinate leaders. Commanders provide top-down guidance in training focus, direction, and resources. Subordinate leaders provide feedback on unit task proficiency, refinement of training resource needs, and the execution of training to standard. This team effort helps maintain training focus, coordination, and synchronization of resources; establishes training priorities; and enables effective communication between command echelons. Training Management 14 June 2021 FM 7-0 1-5 TRAINING AS LEADER DEVELOPMENT 1-20. Effective training and leader development are the keys to operational success. Leader development is continuous and life long, within the institutional base at every stage and within operating forces. Training represents the best leader development possible. Commanders must invest time and resources in leader development. They treat leader development with the same degree of detailed planning and execution as they would a training event. Unit training provides the framework for leaders to develop their leadership skills and evolve as effective leaders. Training provides significant learning opportunities for junior leaders to make and learn from mistakes and improve their leadership proficiency. Senior leaders teach, coach, mentor, and guide junior leaders, underwriting their honest mistakes without prejudice. (See FM 6-22 and resources such as the Project Athena Leader Self-Development Tool available at https://capl.army.mil for more information on leader development methods and activities.) 1-21. Training and leader development are linked and mutually supportive of each other. Leaders must train their subordinate leaders to train effectively as the unit plans and prepares, executes, evaluates, and assesses training. Short of combat, unit training provides the best and most practical leader development possible. The truth of this becomes evident in how leaders train to perform in combat situations—under extreme stress. The experiences gained and lessons learned as the unit trains form the solid foundation for effective leadership. 1-22. Every Army leader has the responsibility for the professional development of subordinate leaders as training occurs. Leader development is a proactive process and is an integral part of training plans, meetings, and briefings. Leaders develop subordinate leaders by—  Establishing leader goals, objectives, and expectations as part of every training event as senior leaders guide junior leaders toward operational and professional success.  Developing leaders who can fight their formations and win—training is the key/most important leader development we do.  Ensuring training plans include leader development training objectives. A training objective is a statement that describes the desired outcome of a training event.  Evaluating and assessing leaders as part of the training process. TRAINING MANAGEMENT CYCLE 1-23. The training management cycle is the process of prioritizing training, planning and preparation, execution, and the evaluation and assessment of training. The commander drives the training management cycle by prioritizing training and assessing unit training proficiencies. Long-, mid-, and short-range planning is conducted to support the execution of training. Continuous feedback through evaluation and other key inputs provides the commander information to assess unit training proficiencies accurately. This manual uses the training management cycle as its framework. See figure 1-2 on page 1-6 that illustrates the training management cycle. (See the Army Training Network (ATN) at https://atn.army.mil for the training management cycle.) Chapter 1 1-6 FM 7-0 14 June 2021 Figure 1-2. The training management cycle 14 June 2021 FM 7-0 2-1 Chapter 2 Prioritizing Training Do essential things first…. Each commander [must] determine wisely what is essential, and assign responsibilities for accomplishment. …Non-essentials should not take up time required for essentials. General Bruce C. Clarke OVERVIEW 2-1. Prioritizing training acknowledges that units cannot achieve or sustain trained proficiency on every task simultaneously due to limitations of time or the availability of training resources. Commanders use a prioritized training approach to optimize limited training time and resources to achieve proficiencies based on their unit’s mission. To focus this effort, the commander in dialogue with the next higher echelon commander determines the priorities for each proficiency (mission-essential tasks, weapons qualification, and collective live-fire tasks) based on mission requirements. Similarly, commanders determine and establish training priorities in preparation for operational deployments, a combat training center rotation, or daily services for installation support. Prioritized training must link to the unit’s mission. Every unit is unique, but the fundamentals of shoot, move, communicate, and survive apply to all types of formations and serve as the basis for prioritization. MISSION-ESSENTIAL TASK 2-2. A mission-essential task is a collective task on which an organization trains to be proficient in its designed capabilities or assigned mission. A mission-essential task list is a tailored group of mission- essential tasks. See figure 2-1 for the relationship of the mission-essential task (MET) and the mission- essential task list (METL). Figure 2-1.The unit METL is based on the unit’s mission and capabilities ARMY STANDARD MISSION-ESSENTIAL TASK LISTS 2-3. Most deployable company level and above units have a standard METL. These are proponent developed and approved by Headquarters, Department of the Army. A standard METL reflects the unit’s design capabilities. (See the Army Training Network website (ATN) at https://atn.army.mil for more on standard METLs.) MISSION-ESSENTIAL TASK PRIORITIZATION 2-4. Due to time and resource limitations, units are rarely able to achieve and sustain fully trained proficiency on all METs simultaneously. Commanders therefore prioritize their METs to identify the METs that must be resourced and trained to ‘T’ proficiency. Prioritization of METs is based on mission requirements (concept plan or operation plan and future expected missions) approved by the next higher Chapter 2 2-2 FM 7-0 14 June 2021 echelon commander. METs identified and approved as lower priority are resourced to maintain proficiency, but are not the unit’s training priority. PRIORITIZING COLLECTIVE TASKS BELOW COMPANY LEVEL 2-5. Leaders of echelons below company level (platoons, squads, crews, teams, and other small units) must also prioritize the collective tasks on which their echelon trains. Limited time and resources prevent lower echelon organizations from simultaneously attaining a ‘T’ proficiency on all collective tasks that support their organization’s METs. Therefore, leaders of echelons below company level select and prioritize the collective tasks for their echelon that are most critical to the accomplishment of their company’s prioritized METs. These prioritized collective tasks below company level that are critical to the successful accomplishment of prioritized company METs are battle tasks. A battle task is a platoon or lower echelon collective task that is crucial to the successful accomplishment of a company, battery, or troop mission- essential task. An organization’s battle tasks can include high-payoff tasks or battle drills. 2-6. Platoon leaders with the assistance of their platoon sergeant identify and prioritize the battle tasks that best support their company’s prioritized METs. This process continues to lower echelons with noncommissioned officers determining the prioritized battle tasks that best apply to their echelon (such as squad, team, or crew). Company commanders are responsible for the proper nesting of battle tasks to METs. 2-7. Based on organizational structure and design, some units may not perform collective tasks at certain echelons. In these cases, the unit’s leaders proceed by linking prioritized individual tasks to the next higher level of unit collective tasks (in some cases, these may be METs). PRIORITIZING INDIVIDUAL TASKS 2-8. Task prioritization continues as noncommissioned officers identify and prioritize the individual tasks Soldiers train. These include military occupational specialty (known as MOS)-specific tasks, Army warrior tasks, and physical readiness training. Prioritization of tasks ensures the right tasks to train nest from the highest echelon to the lowest. (See appendix C for individual training.) PRIORITIZING LEADER TASKS 2-9. Leaders develop subordinate leaders through focused leader development activities to include the selection and prioritization of leader tasks. Senior leaders ensure the selection and prioritization of leader tasks nest in the echelon’s prioritized METs or battle tasks and are reflected in the organization’s leader development program. PRIORITIZING STAFF TASKS 2-10. Battalion and higher staffs select staff battle tasks in the same manner. They select those staff collective and individual tasks that support the unit’s METs through training. The senior member of each staff section approves staff battle tasks. SUPPORTING COLLECTIVE TASKS 2-11. METs and battle tasks may be trained individually or combined with other collective tasks to create more robust training events. Collective tasks that support other collective tasks (MET, battle task, or another collective task) are supporting collective tasks. Although units may train supporting collective tasks in conjunction with METs and battle tasks, leaders do not consider these supporting collective tasks when determining the MET or battle task proficiency rating. Each collective task is evaluated based on its own training and evaluation outline. HIGH-PAYOFF TASKS 2-12. High-payoff tasks are tasks that support more than one of the organization’s METs or battle tasks. The skills and proficiencies an organization achieved while training on a high-payoff task transfers to other METs Prioritizing Training 14 June 2021 FM 7-0 2-3 or battle tasks that it supports. Such skills and proficiencies are key to multiechelon training. Leaders recognize and capitalize on the training efficiencies gained by identifying high-payoff tasks. METL DEVELOPMENT FOR UNITS WITHOUT A STANDARD METL 2-13. Units without a standard METL must create one. The standards for many of the collective tasks these units routinely perform are published and should be considered for METs if critical to the unit mission. When there is no published standard for a task the unit performs, the unit coordinates with the proponent to develop and approve it. If developing a METL, units consider the following guidelines in table 2-1. Table 2-1. Considerations for developing a unit METL  Mission-essential tasks are Army collective tasks.  No more than seven mission-essential tasks.  Each mission-essential task supports the HQDA-standard METL of the next higher unit (if applicable).  Refer to task training and evaluation outlines (T&EOs) as a resource. HQDA Headquarters, Department of the Army METL mission-essential task list ASSIGNED MISSION METL 2-14. The Army sometimes assigns brigade and higher echelons missions that do not fit neatly within their Department of the Army standard METL. Through mission analysis and commanders’ dialogue, the unit may identify additional METs critical to the success of the mission. WEAPONS QUALIFICATION PRIORITIZATION 2-15. The commander considers the priority of weapons qualification training based on qualification frequency specified by AR 350-1, current qualification status of the unit’s organic weapons systems (individual, crew-served, platform), and the unit mission. This consideration drives the commander’s determination of which weapons systems have priority for training. 2-16. All Soldiers are expected to qualify on their assigned weapons; however, some Soldiers have a system as their primary weapon such as a radar or sensor. These systems also require qualification. COLLECTIVE LIVE-FIRE PRIORITIZATION 2-17. The commander determines collective live-fire prioritization based on the organization’s mission, capabilities, and directed requirements by senior commanders. (See appendix I for details about live-fire training.) This page intentionally left blank. 14 June 2021 FM 7-0 3-1 Chapter 3 Planning and Preparation Training in all its phases must be intensive… It must be intelligently directed so that every individual, including the last private in the ranks, can understand the reasons for the exertions he is called upon to make. General Dwight D. Eisenhower OVERVIEW 3-1. Planning in the training management cycle aligns prioritized training tasks with resources over time. The commander plans training one echelon down and ensures training two echelons down is evaluated. The commander does this, assisted by the staff, by developing a plan that projects the sequencing of training events required to achieve necessary mission-essential task proficiency levels. The standards required to achieve task proficiency are prescribed in Army training and evaluation outlines for tasks and applicable weapon system publications. The planning process begins with the commander providing principal inputs: prioritized mission-essential tasks, weapons qualification, collective live-fire tasks, and the commander’s assessment of the unit’s training proficiencies. TRAINING BATTLE RHYTHM 3-2. Commanders establish the unit’s training battle rhythm to integrate and synchronize training activities, meetings, briefings, conferences, and reports. Establishing a training battle rhythm helps sequence and formalize these activities to regulate the flow and sharing of training information across the command. Examples of training battle rhythm activities include—  Training resource synchronization conferences.  Published formal training guidance (such as annual training guidance, semi-annual training guidance, and quarterly training guidance).  Training briefings (such as annual training briefing, semi-annual training briefing, and quarterly training briefing).  Training meetings.  Training support meetings.  Commander-to-commander dialogues.  Published company training schedules.  T-Week coordination. LONG-RANGE PLANNING AND PREPARATION 3-3. Long-range planning and preparation determine the training required to progress from the unit’s current state of training proficiency to the desired proficiency level. The unit commander conducts long- range planning to sequence training events with resources over time to determine who, what, when, and where to train. Long-range preparation ensures coordination and actions needed to secure long-lead time resources are accomplished prior to training. The long-range planning process culminates in the publication of annual training guidance (known as ATG) and a long-range training calendar. See table 3-1 and table 3-2 on page 3-2 for training guidance publication cycles. Chapter 3 3-2 FM 7-0 14 June 2021 Table 3-1. Regular Army training guidance publication cycle Echelon Annual Semi-Annual (Refinement to ATG as required) Quarterly (Refinement to ATG as required) ASCC 16 months prior to FY (June) N/A N/A ACOM 16 months prior to FY (June) N/A N/A Corps 14 months prior to FY (August) 8 months prior to mid-year (August) N/A Division 12 months prior to FY (October) 6 months prior to mid-year (October) N/A Installation 10 months prior to FY (December) N/A N/A Brigade 9 months prior to FY (February) 5 months prior to mid-year (November) 2 months prior to quarter Battalion 6 months prior to FY (April) 4 months prior to mid-year (December) 1 month prior to quarter Company 4 months prior to FY (June) 2 months prior to mid-year (February) 2 weeks prior to quarter *Annual training guidance format is at the discretion of the commander and includes the long-range training calendar. *Company commanders may issue training guidance informally at training meetings. *Publication dates also apply to similar command-level TDA organizations or activities.

CMD command TDA table of distribution and allowances FY fiscal year NLT no later than PLANNING AND PREPARATION CONSIDERATIONS 3-4. In developing the unit’s long-range training plan, commanders and planners account for several key planning considerations. These include—  Higher headquarters training guidance and training requirements. Commanders need to account for higher headquarters training directives and time management system to ensure that they nest their training to meet the higher commander’s intent.  Time management system. Commanders prioritize training time by utilizing a time management system. A time management system is a method of protecting allocated training time and resources for subordinate units while accounting for necessary Army requirements that detract from training. Higher commanders account for all organizations within their command and utilize an equitable Planning and Preparation 14 June 2021 FM 7-0 3-3 time management system based on unit training priorities and missions. The most common time management system used within the Army is the Green-Amber-Red cycle:  Green cycle. Units in the green cycle have training resource priority and focus predominately on unit collective training. Higher commanders protect these units from taskings and training distracters. Green cycle is also referred to as prime time training.  Amber cycle. Amber cycle units have training resource priority behind green cycle units. Commanders normally focus training in the amber cycle on small unit, individual, leader, and battle task proficiency. Higher commanders only assign amber cycle units taskings that exceed red cycle units’ ability to support.  Red cycle. Units in red cycle are the primary organizations that execute higher headquarters directed support taskings. Units in this cycle still conduct training, but training focuses primarily on individual tasks, weapon proficiency and self-development opportunities.  Training events. Commanders design and schedule training events focused on achieving the desired proficiency levels in their prioritized tasks. Commanders define training objectives for each training event by clearly identifying the tasks, conditions, and standards as well as the expected outcome. They develop unit training proficiencies following a systematic process starting with supporting individual tasks and progressing through the unit’s prioritized mission- essential tasks.  Utilize the crawl-walk-run method. Commanders sequence training events from relatively simple to increasingly more complex. This methodology known as crawl-walk-run develops unit training proficiencies in a progressive sequence and ensures that task proficiencies build on each other, laying a solid foundation before moving on to more complex tasks and increasingly complex conditions. See figure 3-1 for the crawl-walk-run method. Figure 3-1. Sample crawl-walk-run training events  Allocate the necessary training time and resources to enable subordinate organizations to train to standard. Most non-staff training is executed at the platoon and below. For example, in a typical brigade, 70–80 percent of training should occur at platoon level and below, 10–15 percent at company, and 5–10 percent at battalion and brigade. However, all training should seek multiechelon training opportunities and battalions and brigades should leverage command post exercises to command and control lower echelon training to build and sustain proficiency. For example, battalions should establish a command and control element during platoon exercises. (See appendix F for training exercises.)  Multiechelon training. Multiechelon training is a training technique that allows for the simultaneous training of one or more echelons on different or complementary tasks (ADP 7-0). As each echelon conducts its analysis to determine tasks to train, individual Soldier tasks to brigade-level mission-essential tasks are nested where possible. Chapter 3 3-4 FM 7-0 14 June 2021  Training environments. Conducting all training events in a live environment is impractical and not always possible; hence, whenever possible leverage all of the three training environments—live, virtual, and constructive. Training live most closely replicates combat conditions and is the most effective and valuable option. Virtual enablers add significant value by helping in the preparation phase to set conditions for live, during execution by complementing live, and in the retraining phase by enabling maximum “repetitions” to sustain proficiency over time. (See appendix I for live-fire training.)  Live training is executed in field conditions using tactical equipment. It involves real people operating real systems. Units execute virtual training using computer-generated simulators (gaming is a subset of the virtual training environment). They execute constructive training using computer models and simulations to exercise command and staff functions.  Risk management. Training, especially in a live environment, carries an inherent risk to Soldiers, equipment, and the physical environment.Commanders and leaders effectively manage risk by putting in place a system to continuously monitor risk mitigation. The Army uses risk management to help maintain combat power while ensuring mission accomplishment. Commanders and leaders utilize the five steps of risk management as outlined in ATP 5-19: Step 1–identify the hazards, Step 2–assess the hazards, Step 3–develop controls and make risk decisions, Step 4–implement controls, Step 5–supervise and evaluate. 3-5. Other long-range preparations include identifying training resources requiring long-lead times for coordination. These resources can include the following:  Class V ammunition forecasting.  Training area identification and coordination.  Field feeding.  Medical support.  Transportation.  Opposing forces.  External evaluators.  Training facilities, like unit conduct of fire trainer and aviation simulators.  Coordinating training support not on the installation.  Locking-in school slots.  Integration and coordination of low-density military occupational specialty (known as MOS) training.  Army certification such as Expert Infantryman Badge, Expert Soldier Badge, and Expert Field Medical Badge. LONG-RANGE TRAINING PLAN CONTENT 3-6. When complete, the long-range training plan includes the following elements:  The unit’s prioritized mission-essential tasks, weapons qualifications, and collective live-fire tasks to train.  The required proficiencies (T or P) to achieve.  A deadline to achieve training proficiencies.  An operational environment to replicate in training.  Time management cycle.  Unit training events.  Scheduled maintenance services.  External evaluation expectations, responsibilities, and schedules.  Collective live-fire, gunnery, and frequency requirements.  Individual training guidance such as Army Warrior Training (to include warrior tasks and battle drills) and low-density military occupational specialty training.  Physical training focus. Planning and Preparation 14 June 2021 FM 7-0 3-5  Leader development plans and training objectives.  Leader certification.  Long-range training calendar. LONG-RANGE TRAINING PLAN APPROVAL 3-7. The commander two levels up approves the unit’s long-range training plan. This approval and commander-to-commander contract is normally part of an annual training briefing (known as ATB). The senior commander approves the subordinate unit’s—  Current training proficiency assessment.  Mission-essential task prioritization, weapons qualification guidance, and collective live-fire requirements.  Long-range training plan to ensure it—  Is nested within the higher unit’s training plan.  Is resourced appropriately.  Can accomplish the subordinate unit’s progression to the designated level of training proficiency.  Lower priority tasks that will not be trained until a later date. 3-8. The approved training plan becomes a contract between the senior and subordinate commanders. It represents the senior commanders’ commitment to resource subordinate unit training and protect it from un- programmed training distracters. The subordinate commander commits to conducting the training as briefed or with approved modifications. LONG-RANGE TRAINING PLAN PUBLICATION 3-9. When approved, the long-range training plan is published as annual training guidance to subordinate, higher, and other affected commands as necessary. The format of the annual training guidance is at the discretion of the commander and includes the long-range training calendar. (See appendix A for more on training guidance.) RESERVE COMPONENT CONSIDERATIONS 3-10. Both the Regular Army and Reserve Component (RC) share the same training doctrine, share procedures, and train to the same standard. However, the training environment, planning horizons, and time available to train differ for RC units. 3-11. Geographic dispersion of units affects the RC training environment increasing the complexity for these units to accomplish training. Reserve units must account for additional resource considerations when determining training areas—either a Regular Army or RC training installation—to accomplish training to standard. 3-12. RC commanders prioritize available training days and synchronize resources over extended planning horizons, often over the span of several years. To mitigate this, RC units rely on a training month approach, T-Month, concept similar to the T-Week framework. (See appendix E for details on the T-Week framework.) MID-RANGE PLANNING AND PREPARATION 3-13. Mid-range planning and preparation is based on the approved annual training guidance. It ensures resources are coordinated for and confirmed prior to training events. It focuses on a semi-annual and by- quarter refinement and execution of the annual training guidance (known as ATG). (See appendix A for more on training guidance.) Some of the critical activities that occur during mid-range planning and preparation include— Chapter 3 3-6 FM 7-0 14 June 2021  Published semi-annual training guidance (known as SATG) and quarterly training guidance (known as QTG).  Semi-annual training briefings (known as SATBs) and quarterly training briefings (known as QTBs) provide periodic updates of subordinate unit training progress to senior commanders. Semi-annual training briefings and quarterly training briefings are provided to the commander two levels above. Battalion commanders brief the division commander and company commanders brief the brigade commander. The briefings are designed to discuss past, present, and future training expectations and to approve any necessary modifications to the annual training guidance. The briefing results in a training contract or agreement between the senior and subordinate commanders consisting of two parts. First, upon approval of the subordinate commander’s plan, the senior commander agrees to provide resources and protect the subordinate unit from un- programmed training distracters. Second, the subordinate commander agrees to execute the approved training to standard.  Training meetings are conducted to refine training guidance and training calendars. At battalion and brigade levels, these meetings focus on overall annual training guidance progress and ensuring training resources for subordinate companies are coordinated and available when training begins. (See appendix E for more discussions on training meetings.)  Leader development plan. Leaders create leader development plans focused on improving and sustaining subordinate leader skills and attributes as unit training progresses. This planning is also discussed during training meetings and annual training briefings, semi-annual training briefings, and quarterly training briefings.  Installation training resource conference attendance. These conferences provide home station units visibility of training resource usage and scheduling on the installation. Attendance gives unit leaders and training planners opportunities to review, coordinate, and secure these major resources (such as ranges, training areas, and simulators) for future training. They also help de-conflict potential scheduling issues between using units.  Training and certifying leaders is crucial in delivering quality, effective training. Training and certifying leaders ensures qualified leaders are subject matter experts and can perform tasks to standard. The commander sets the criteria for certification ensuring these leaders are well trained and prepared to evaluate and train others before training begins. Training and certification accomplishes two goals. First, it provides the commander and other unit leaders confidence that the leader being trained and certified is professional and competent in training and evaluating others. Secondly, it provides the training audience confidence that trainers know their craft expertly—building trust and confidence not just in the trainer, but in themselves and the unit. Commanders are responsible for establishing an effective leader training and certification program for the unit. They continually monitor and adjust the unit certification process to ensure unit training is led by competent leaders who set the example to those trained. SHORT-RANGE PLANNING AND PREPARATION 3-14. Company and below units manage training in the short-range planning horizon primarily through company training meetings. (See appendix E for training meetings.) In this planning horizon, training schedules are approved and published, final pre-execution checks and coordination are conducted, and supplies are delivered. The Training-Week (T-Week) framework is a planning technique that aligns the weeks prior to and after a training event to the actions or activities that must be accomplished. For example, ‘Week T’ is the week of execution, ‘Week T-6’ is six weeks prior to execution, and ‘Week T+1’ is the week following execution. COMPANY TRAINING SCHEDULES 3-15. Company training schedules are the culmination of long-, mid-, and short-range planning and preparation. During long-range planning, the company commander sequences training events with resources over time to determine who, what, when, and where to train to ensure coordination and resources. 3-16. Company training schedules ensure training is conducted on time, by qualified trainers, and with the necessary resources. Company training schedules are priorities of work tied to timelines. Company Planning and Preparation 14 June 2021 FM 7-0 3-7 commanders develop training schedules no later than 6 weeks prior to training. The company commander signs and the battalion commander approves training schedules no later than 6 weeks prior to training execution, generally at the conclusion of the weekly battalion training meeting. 3-17. Training schedules are posted in company common areas and are provided to Soldiers. Figure 3-2 illustrates a sample training schedule. At a minimum, company training schedules include the following information:  Date and time of training (start and end).  Attendees.  Tasks trained (task title and numbers for reference).  Trainer (primary and alternate).  Uniform and equipment.  Location (such as training areas or facilities).  References (such as FM 6-22 and TC 7-101).  Authentication (company commander signature and battalion commander signature when approved). Figure 3-2. Sample company training schedule CHANGES TO APPROVED TRAINING SCHEDULES 3-18. To enable predictability and consistent quality execution, events codified in a training schedule should not change. However, changes to approved training are sometimes unavoidable. Any substantive changes between Weeks T-6 through T-4 require battalion commander approval, changes between Weeks T-3 through T-2 require brigade commander approval, and any change inside Week T-1 requires division commander approval. Consistent changes within two weeks of training indicate a commander failure to accurately plan unit training or higher commander failure to protect subordinate units from un-forecasted distracters. (See figure 3-3 on page 3-8 for change approval to training schedules.) Chapter 3 3-8 FM 7-0 14 June 2021 3-19. Not all changes to approved training schedules require battalion commander or higher-level approval. Simple administrative changes such as references or instructors can be made by the company commander; however, substantive changes to tasks trained, dates, or cancellations require higher commander approval. Figure 3-3. Approval and change process for training schedules SHORT-RANGE PREPARATION 3-20. Short-range preparation refines specific actions to complete prior to training execution. Some short- range preparations include the following activities:  Continue to conduct training meetings.  Monitor T-Week activities and pre-execution checks.  Complete leader training and certification.  Verify and review training objectives.  Prepare and review task training and evaluation outlines.  Continue to train and certify leaders.  Recon training sites.  Verify convoy clearances submitted and approved.  Verify all classes of supply requests are submitted and ready for pickup.  Issue orders.  Conduct rehearsals.  Draw equipment and supplies to include training aids devices simulators and simulations.  Complete training event risk assessments. (See ATP 5-19 and DD Form 2977 [Deliberate Risk Assessment Worksheet].)  Conduct pre-combat checks and inspections. Short-range planning and preparation is complete when the unit is ready to execute training. TRAINING MODELS 3-21. Training models are an effective technique for small units (company and below) to plan and prepare a training event. They provide a logical and reliable framework of activities and actions for small-unit leaders to plan and prepare, execute, and evaluate single training events. The 8-step training model is the Army’s preeminent training model. Planning and Preparation 14 June 2021 FM 7-0 3-9 8-Step Training Model  Step 1: Plan the training event. Leaders develop specific and measurable training objectives based on the commander’s guidance. They identify and coordinate the resources necessary to train and provide guidance and direction to subordinates. Leaders allocate and ensure Soldiers have enough time for training as well as identify the required resources to train effectively. They identify potential hazards and eliminate or mitigate associated risks. Lastly, leaders develop evaluation plans that support the tasks trained.  Step 2: Train and certify leaders. Certification requirements are established and leaders and trainers are certified to lead and conduct the training. Certified personnel must have detailed knowledge of the training subject matter and have performed the task to standard themselves. This step also includes training and certifying opposing force (OPFOR) leaders.  Step 3: Recon training sites. Leaders perform reconnaissance of training sites and report back observations and potential issues prior to training execution. Leaders verify that training locations can support the training event and enable the unit to accomplish its training objectives. They make contact with site support personnel and solve scheduling and coordination issues.  Step 4: Issue the operation order (OPORD). This order specifies responsibilities, timelines for execution, tactical scenarios, and other key information necessary to execute the training event. Leaders identify the tasks trained, training objectives, the training mission, and the methods to execute the training. Leaders ensure subordinates have all available information to prepare and execute the training event. A successful training event relies on all leaders understanding the expected outcome and remaining focused on the training objectives.  Step 5: Rehearse. Leaders conduct rehearsals to ensure plans are synchronized and actions are understood by subordinates. Leaders supervise rehearsals to ensure those responsible for training are prepared and organized. This step includes conducting rehearsals necessary for OPFOR leaders and personnel.  Step 6: Train. Training is executed, tasks are observed and evaluated, and training objectives are trained until proficiency is achieved. As participants perform tasks, trainers evaluate performance against published standards.  Step 7: Conduct after action reviews. After action reviews (AARs) are conducted during training and after the training event. AAR feedback is provided to the unit commander to help assess task proficiency. Lessons learned are discussed, recorded for future use, and shared with other units and leaders. These reviews help improve unit training as well as the unit’s tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTP).  Step 8: Retrain. Tasks not performed to standard are retrained and re-evaluated until the standard is achieved. Units do not depart the training event with tasks not trained to standard and training objectives not met. This page intentionally left blank. 14 June 2021 FM 7-0 4-1 Chapter 4 Execution The more Soldiers sweat in training, the less they bleed in combat. Proverb OVERVIEW 4-1. Execution is the implementation of the long-range training guidance. It is the deliberate and purposeful accomplishment of each training event’s training objectives. Executing increasingly challenging training events to the prescribed standard builds the training proficiency required to achieve designated mission- essential task proficiency levels. It also develops increasingly capable, confident and lethal Soldiers, leaders, and units. (See the Army Training Network (ATN) at https://atn.army.mil for more information on training execution.) LEADER ROLES IN EXECUTION 4-2. Leaders must know and understand their roles in executing training. Commanders and leaders must—  Be present and actively engaged in training.  Demonstrate tactical and technical proficiency.  Ensure training is conducted to standard as prescribed in Army training and evaluation outlines (known as T&EOs) and applicable weapon system publications. Ensure training is led by trained and certified officers and noncommissioned officers (NCOs).  Protect training by eliminating distractors.  Effectively manage risk by continuously reviewing risk assessment and managing mitigation and control measures. 4-3. Senior NCOs ensure—  Subordinate leaders are trained and prepared.  Training is conducted to standard, not time.  Task execution is repeated until the standard is reached. PRESENTING AND PERFORMING TRAINING 4-4. How training is presented is key to its effectiveness. Training is presented by the chain of command whenever possible. Unit leaders are present and responsible for training even if a technical trainer provides the information. 4-5. Training is performance oriented and is evaluated against established standards found in applicable proponent publications. Those publications can include training and evaluation outlines and training circulars. 4-6. Leaders progressively adjust task conditions to increase task difficulty. This builds task familiarity and Soldier and leader confidence. Leaders add realism and complexity to task conditions as rapidly as possible to achieve near-operational conditions. 4-7. Risk management changes the effectiveness of mitigation measures and controls. Chapter 4 4-2 FM 7-0 14 June 2021 FOCUS ON FUNDAMENTALS 4-8. Commanders and leaders keep it simple: shoot, move, communicate, and survive. Units must master the basics before progressing to increasingly complex tasks. A basic task training focus provides the foundation to build proficiency in individual tasks as the unit progresses to more complex unit collective tasks. TRAIN TO TASK MASTERY ON HIGHEST PRIORITY TASKS 4-9. Task mastery is not a training proficiency rating but a concept that requires full understanding of a task, its component parts, its underlying principles, its importance, and its support to the larger mission. To build task mastery, units focus on fundamentals at individual, crew, squad, and platoon levels before proceeding to higher-level collective tasks. Organizations then gradually increase the difficulty of conditions under which the prioritized task is trained to include limited visibility, degraded communications, loss of key leaders, and unexpected changes in an operational environment. Task mastery goes beyond executing a task to standard through constant repetition. It entails successfully executing multiple iterations (sets and repetitions) of a task under the most challenging and dynamic conditions while constantly adjusting for changes in the operational environment and making the best use of resources. 4-10. Prioritized training acknowledges that mission, limited time, and resources dictate that units train the most important tasks first. However, leaders should not settle for achieving a trained proficiency rating on priority tasks but strive to reach task mastery on them. NIGHT AND ADVERSE WEATHER TRAINING 4-11. Units must be able to operate at night and during adverse weather conditions. Soldiers must be proficient in the use of night vision devices and other limited visibility equipment during operations. Units may conduct reverse-cycle training. In such training, units reverse the normal duty day so that training takes place during reduced or limited visibility. Reverse-cycle training maximizes night training opportunities to make the conduct of individual tasks and unit level operations routine. Conducting ranges and drivers training at night requires more detailed planning and additional resources to mitigate risk. Achieving task mastery at night requires significant leadership focus and unit discipline. Night vision devices require care and maintenance, light discipline requires vigilance and attention to detail, and the confidence necessary for effective operations during limited visibility requires repetitive exposure during training. LIVE-FIRE TRAINING 4-12. Live-fire training involves movement, maneuver, and employing weapons systems in a live training environment using full-caliber ammunition. Live-fire training is a progressive training process culminating in individuals and units’ ability to maneuver safely and effectively while engaging targets using full-caliber ammunition. It includes prerequisite training, weapons qualification, and collective live-fire training. (See appendix I for details on live-fire training.) 4-13. Live-fire training is the primary tool for training—  Marksmanship under field conditions.  Fire distribution and control.  Weapons confidence.  Synchronization of fires and their effects (platoon level and above). 4-14. Live-fire training also provides training in—  Weapons systems familiarization proficiency and qualification.  Execution of battle tasks, drills, and mission-essential task list (known as METL) tasks in a live- fire environment.  Fire control and distribution.  Command and control skills in a live-fire environment.  Individual and unit movement and maneuver techniques under live-fire conditions. Execution 14 June 2021 FM 7-0 4-3  Weapons systems safety awareness and compliance.  Soldier confidence in assigned weapons systems and leader confidence in individual and collective readiness.  Risk management processes and procedures. 4-15. The foundation of unit live-fire proficiency is proficiency with individual and crew-served weapons. Units then progressively train to proficiency at the fire team, squad, platoon, and company levels. Battalions conduct combined arms live-fire training with proficient companies. Brigades do the same with their proficient battalions, ultimately employing joint fires when resources allow. 4-16. Live-fire training progresses in three stages:  Prerequisite training.  Weapons qualification (such as individual, crew served, and platform).  Live-fire. (See appendix I for more information on live-fire training.) SIMULATIONS 4-17. Commanders conduct training in a live environment as much as possible. There are times when conducting training in a strictly live environment is not possible or practical. Simulations allow unlimited sets and repetitions to train and retrain skills allowing individuals and units to enter live training at a much higher level of proficiency and competency. With a simulation’s continued use, units can better sustain levels of proficiency. Senior leaders ensure simulations remain relevant, challenging, and are included in qualification standards. Examples of training simulations include—  Aviation simulators.  Unit conduct of fire trainers.  Driver training simulators.  Call for fire trainers.  Constructive and virtual (to include gaming) training support. 4-18. Simulations allow commanders to plan training and think innovatively. They give commanders the ability to leverage multiple technologies to link live, virtual, and constructive training environments to best replicate an expanded operational environment. For example, simulations enhance the command and staff experience at mission training complexes by integrating real-time external inputs to replicate a more complete operational picture. 4-19. Every installation manages simulation resources for unit use—commanders know the simulations available and incorporate their use as they plan and execute training. Simulations are an integral component to live, virtual, and constructive training environments. (See appendix J for more on training environments.) LEVERAGING MULTIECHELON TRAINING AND LIVE, VIRTUAL, AND CONSTRUCTIVE TRAINING 4-20. Commanders use all available training environments to maximize realism to multiechelon training. This is especially important in an era of declining training budgets, limited training resources, and available time to train. Commanders must be knowledgeable of and integrate all possible assets available to make training as realistic and challenging as possible. This integration of multiechelon training and use of live, virtual, and constructive training resources takes leadership, foresight, and detailed planning and execution. 4-21. As an example, some units deploying to the National Training Center (known as NTC) conduct multiechelon training by incorporating live and constructive simulation training and distributed learning capabilities back to home station, to include additional division enablers. This technique incorporates live training and leverages significant technological capabilities of constructive simulations while geographically dispersed. Such an integrated technique adds a dimension of realism not possible or practical by training in a live environment only. Chapter 4 4-4 FM 7-0 14 June 2021 4-22. The benefits of the live, virtual, and constructive training approach delivers a higher degree of training realism and ultimately improved training proficiencies at every echelon in the command. This is especially advantageous when training to conduct complex, multiechelon large-scale combat operations. (See appendix J for more information on different training environments.) TRAINING TECHNIQUES 4-23. Training techniques provide leaders effective ways to train in achieving task standards. Leaders and units are innovative as they adapt training techniques to their organizations. These techniques are prioritized through commander-to-commander dialogues. DRILLS 4-24. Drills provide standard actions that link Soldier and collective tasks at staff and platoon levels and below. There are two types of drills—battle drills and crew drills:  A battle drill is a collective action where Soldiers and leaders rapidly process information, make decisions, and execute without a deliberate decision-making process. For example, a staff performs a battle drill to exercise a command post.  A crew drill is a collective action that the crew of a weapon or piece of equipment must perform to use the weapon or equipment. It is a trained response to a given stimulus, or initiated cue, such as a leader order or the status of the weapon or equipment. Crew drills require minimal leader orders to accomplish. LANE TRAINING 4-25. Lane training is a company and below training technique designed to practice, observe, and evaluate individual tasks, collective tasks, or battle drills. It allows the unit to focus on the critical tasks, allows for consistent and uniform assessments, and maximizes the use of available time. In lane training, a small unit operates from a stationary position or tactically moves mounted or dismounted through a prescribed land course (a lane). A trained observer evaluates unit performance as the lane is executed. (See appendix G for more on lane training.) OPPORTUNITY TRAINING 4-26. Opportunity training (also referred to as hip-pocket training) consists of individual tasks or crew-based skills trained when there are inactive periods (down time) during scheduled training. It is a part of multiechelon training and is used for improving or sustaining task proficiency when time is available. Opportunity training requires forethought, leader certification, and appropriate resourcing prior to execution. Skills selected for opportunity training must support unit-prioritized mission-essential tasks and battle tasks. Tasks and drills often selected for opportunity training are those that leaders can easily train in 10 to 20 minutes. 4-27. The platoon leader in concert with the platoon sergeant approves the individual tasks or crew drills for opportunity training, usually during platoon training meetings. A key element to opportunity training is that the tasks or drills are pre-selected, with every leader within the platoon ready to execute and evaluate the tasks at any time when the opportunity avails itself. Training time is limited and precious—there can be no down time during a training event—so when an opportunity arises, leaders are ready and prepared to fill time gaps in training. SERGEANT’S TIME TRAINING 4-28. Sergeant’s time training (many units call this leader’s time training) provides scheduled training time set aside by unit commanders for unit NCOs to train their Soldiers in specified tasks and skills. It requires preparation, resourcing, and predictability so commanders and leaders at every level protect, support, incorporate, and maximize the importance of sergeant’s time training during company training. Sergeant’s time training is standards-based, is performance-oriented, and supports unit mission-essential tasks and battle tasks. Mutual trust and confidence between Soldiers and their first line leaders are absolutely critical Execution 14 June 2021 FM 7-0 4-5 outcomes to sergeant’s time training. Leaders capitalize on high-payoff tasks that support more than one of the organization’s mission-essential tasks or battle tasks. This is because the skills and proficiencies achieved while training a high-payoff task transfer to other mission-essential tasks or battle tasks. AFTER ACTION REVIEW 4-29. An after action review is a guided analysis of an organization’s performance, conducted at appropriate times during and at the conclusion of a training event or operation with the objective of improving future performance. An after action review (AAR) can be formal or informal (sometimes called a hotwash) and includes a facilitator, event participants, and other observers. 4-30. AARs also signal the start of the next planning cycle. Lessons learned from the review of performance provide leaders the specifics of what and how to perform better for future training. The AAR process ensures participants self-discover what went right, what went wrong, and how to perform to standard next time. Leaders capture AAR results to craft more effective training plans and execution. AARs also help leaders frame the unit’s retraining efforts. To the greatest extent, training is not complete until all training objectives are met. When this is not possible, leaders ensure retraining is planned and executed as expeditiously as possible. (For more detailed descriptions and discussions for conducting AARs, see appendix K.) RECORDING RESULTS 4-31. Units always record and retain the results of training. The method used to record training is at the commander’s discretion (except as specified by AR 350-1 or a local command directive). These records represent valuable training information that capture the results of training, replicate training events previously conducted, or develop innovative ways to improve training techniques and procedures. 4-32. Recording the results of training is critical for leaders to project future training requirements based on unit personnel turbulence. Training requirements are catalogued in leader books and battle rosters to ensure these training gaps are filled as expeditiously as possible as new personnel arrive in the unit. (See the Army Training Network Army Training Network (ATN) https://atn.army.mil for leader books and tools.) 4-33. Units maintain training records in—  Leader books.  Battle rosters.  Certification.  Army web-based training management systems. 4-34. Leader books are a tool for NCOs to maintain reference information on their Soldiers’ individual training status. NCOs track individual task proficiency, warrior tasks and battle drill proficiency, crew qualification status, weapons qualification, maintenance status, equipment accountability, and other Soldier- related information and data. (See appendix C for individual training.) 4-35. Battle rosters help leaders track key training information on selected systems. Leaders maintain battle rosters at battalion level and below. The exact composition of battle rosters varies depending on the mission and type of unit. 4-36. Certification is a process in which the unit commander specifies qualification and competency criteria to ensure trainers and leaders meet proficiency standards. The record of certifications are retained for training management purposes. Examples of certification include Expert Infantryman Badge, driver’s license, and Combat Lifesaver. 4-37. Army web-based training management systems are available for units to maintain training records through the Army Training Network (https://atn.army.mil). Examples of training records available through the Army Training Network include mission-essential task assessments, training plans, and individual and unit training records.

McNair OVERVIEW 5-1. The training evaluation and assessment process provides commanders a process to judge the organization’s training proficiency. Accurate assessments provide the basis for the unit’s entire training effort. It is a continuous process based on a wide variety of inputs and feedback. These inputs include Soldier, subordinate leader, and noncommissioned officer observations and evaluations, external reports and inspections, after action reviews, and senior leader observations. (See the Army Training Network (ATN) at https://atn.army.mil  for more information on training evaluation and assessment.) 5-2. Evaluating and assessing training proficiency is a two-step process:  Evaluation.  Assessment. EVALUATION 5-3. All training is evaluated. Evaluation is the observation of performance measured against standards.For individual tasks (Army warrior and military occupational specialty tasks), drills, other collective tasks, and collective live-fire tasks, training and evaluation outlines (T&EOs) are the reference for task standards. (See appendix D for T&EOs.) For weapons qualification standards, the applicable weapon system publications are the principle reference. 5-4. The commander relies heavily on evaluation results when assessing proficiency. Evaluations can be executed using internal or external assets. The evaluation of training occurs during the execution phase of training events as well as during the planning and preparation phases as leaders continually find ways to improve unit tactics, techniques, and procedures. Additionally, leaders use evaluations as opportunities to coach and mentor subordinates. EVALUATION PLANNING 5-5. Commanders ensure a supporting evaluation plan exists for training events. This plan provides trained and certified evaluators with a process to observe and record task proficiency. Evaluators record the results of their observations and provide them to the commander at the conclusion of training as part of feedback. EXTERNAL EVALUATION 5-6. External evaluations (EXEVALs) are directed and resourced by the commander two echelons above the evaluated unit. Leaders outside the evaluated unit’s chain of command conduct these evaluations. EXEVALs are conducted down to platoon level, but at the commander’s discretion can be conducted below platoon. The selected collective tasks to validate become EXEVAL training objectives. The EXEVAL exercises unit command and control, communications, movement, and operations against an actual or simulated opposing force in a replicated operational environment. (See appendix H and AR 350-1 for additional information on EXEVALs.) Chapter 5 5-2 FM 7-0 14 June 2021 ASSESSMENT 5-7. Only commanders assess training. Based on observed task performance and other feedback, the commander renders a proficiency assessment (Trained, Practiced, Untrained). The commander’s assessment also informs planning for future training events on the areas that require improvement or sustainment. 5-8. Commanders take a holistic view of feedback when assessing training. (See figure 5-1 for assessing training holistically.) A holistic view ensures that the final assessment is not based on one or a few sources of feedback but is a balanced consideration of all available information. T&EOs should not be the sole source of feedback the commander considers in making an assessment. However, T&EOs carry the predominance of input when commanders consider whether the unit can or cannot perform a task to standard. The results of the commander’s assessments are recorded for future reference. Figure 5-1. Commanders take a holistic approach to assessing training 14 June 2021 FM 7-0 A-1 Appendix A Commander’s Training Guidance OVERVIEW A-1. Commanders provide clear and concise guidance on what is trained, when it is trained, who is trained, and why—task and purpose. Prioritizing training acknowledges that units cannot achieve or sustain trained proficiency on every task simultaneously. Commanders must clearly articulate what lower priority tasks will be trained at a later date. Published training guidance provides subordinate commanders and leaders a clear vision of their training expectations giving the unit direction, purpose, and motivation necessary to train effectively. Commanders issue formal long-range training guidance annually by publishing annual training guidance (ATG) with a long-range training calendar. Mid-range and short-range planning and preparation is based on the ATG. Mid-range training guidance is published semi-annually as semi-annual training guidance (known as SATG) and quarterly as quarterly training guidance (known as QTG). Commanders make updates as required through commander-to-commander dialogues. (See the Army Training Network (ATN) at https://atn.army.mil for training guidance.) A-2. Commanders issue training guidance annually, semi-annually, and quarterly by communicating operations, general thoughts, observations, and status of the command’s training efforts. Situations that commanders consider when developing training guidance include—  Commander-to-commander dialogues.  The command’s current training plans and strategies.  Changes in mission-essential task required proficiency, weapons proficiency, or collective live- fire proficiency.  Publication of senior headquarters ATG.  Major changes to training resources availability.  Changes in operational environment, threat conditions, or unit regional alignment. A-3. The ATG publication is a top-down process that ensures subordinate commanders have the necessary training guidance required to formulate their echelon’s long-range training plans and coordinate necessary resources. Its fiscal year (FY) framework places a common parameter on planning horizons across echelons. This process facilitates subordinate long-range planning and preparation by sequencing higher echelon guidance in a timely and predictable fashion that covers a specified timeframe. (See figure A-1 for a sample ATG publication timeline.) Figure A-1. Example FY 2024 ATG publication timeline by echelon Appendix A A-2 FM 7-0 14 June 2021 A-4. Informed by the Army’s Regionally Aligned Readiness and Modernization Model (known as ReARMM), the process begins with the Army Synchronization and Resourcing Conference (known as ASRC). This conference synchronizes Army activities across four lines of effort (operational requirements, training and exercises, modernization, and other Army service requirements). After participating in the Army Synchronization and Resourcing Conference, Army commands and Army Service component commands issue their ATG no later than 16 months prior to the beginning of the FY. After integrating the Army command’s guidance into their ATG, corps publish it no later than 14 months prior to the start of the FY. Similarly, divisions publish their ATG to subordinate organizations after incorporating the corps’ guidance no later than 12 months prior to the beginning of the FY. Along the same lines, brigades issue ATG no later than 9 months prior to the start of the FY, battalions issue ATG no later than 6 months prior to the beginning of the FY, and companies issue ATG no later than 4 months prior to the start of the FY. COMMANDER’S GUIDANCE FOR DEVELOPMENT OF LONG- RANGE TRAINING PLANS A-5. Unit commanders issue guidance to their staff in the development of long-range training plans and then issue training guidance (in the form of ATG) to subordinate commanders. When issuing ATG, commanders must leave sufficient time for subordinate units to develop their own long-range training plans. Parallel and collaborative planning is an important factor in developing long-range training plans. Commanders at every level work together, sharing planning and resource information as each echelon concurrently develops their training plan. A-6. In developing unit long-range training plans, the commander’s guidance to the staff should include—  The unit’s prioritized mission-essential tasks, weapons qualifications, and collective live-fire tasks to train.  The required proficiencies (T or P) to achieve.  When (date) training proficiencies must be achieved.  An operational environment to replicate in training.  Time management system (Green, Amber, Red).  Unit training events.  External evaluation (known as EXEVAL) expectations and schedule.  Collective live-fire, gunnery, and frequency requirements.  Individual training guidance such as Army Warrior Training (to include warrior tasks and battle drills) and low-density military occupational specialty training.  Physical training focus.  Leader development planning.  Leader certification.  Long-range training calendar.  Additional guidance at the discretion of the commander. Commander’s Training Guidance 14 June 2021 FM 7-0 A-3 Alternative Time Management System to Green, Amber, Red Training is a commander responsibility. Based on the environment and availability of resources, commanders may use alternative models to reach designated proficiency levels. As an example, an alternative system to the Green, Amber, Red time management system is the “P Week” system. The “P Week” system is a prescriptive system that codes certain activities in certain weeks, forcing commanders to account for other requirements such as recovery from training and training preparation. P1 equals a unit’s prime time training window, P2 equals Recovery window, P3 equals Training Preparation window, and P4 equals Offline window with no training authorized (red cycle, block leave). This model is a tool for battalion commanders to give “week intent” while allowing subordinate commanders the freedom to plan and schedule the weeks. It also helps company leaders understand where they should budget their time. It is a prescriptive model where company leaders are not permitted to conduct collective training in a P3 week without battalion commander approval. Appendix A A-4 FM 7-0 14 June 2021 14 June 2021 FM 7-0 B-1 Appendix B Task Crosswalk OVERVIEW B-1. Prioritized mission-essential task (MET) training acknowledges units cannot achieve or sustain fully trained proficiency on every task simultaneously. Commanders focus training on their unit’s prioritized METs to optimize limited training time and resources. Similarly, subordinate leaders prioritize training on the collective tasks, battle tasks, and individual tasks that directly support their unit’s prioritized METs. This is done by conducting a task crosswalk. B-2. A task crosswalk is the process of linking higher echelon tasks to a lower echelon task based on mission requirements. Conducting a task crosswalk allows units to prioritize the tasks most important to train at each echelon. This ensures leaders select the right tasks that best support the unit training mission. For example, individual tasks must link to a team, crew, or squad battle task. Squad battle tasks must link to a platoon battle task. Platoon battle tasks must link to a company MET. The task crosswalk also provides leaders a means to analyze training time requirements and resources to train before progressing to the next level of training. Figure B-1 on page B-2 illustrates a task crosswalk from an infantry brigade MET to individual field artillery Soldier tasks. (See the Army Training Network (ATN) at https://atn.army.mil for task crosswalk examples and procedures.) Appendix B B-2 FM 7-0 14 June 2021 Figure B-1. Example concept of a task crosswalk TASK CROSSWALK PROCESS B-3. The task crosswalk process is a step-by-step process that will produce a prioritized list of focused tasks to train at echelon. Table B-1 on page B-4 identifies important resources to assist leaders in the task crosswalk process. STEP 1: SELECT THE PRIORITIZED HIGHER ECHELON MISSION-ESSENTIAL TASK OR BATTLE TASK TO CROSSWALK B-4. A task crosswalk begins with the highest prioritized higher echelon MET, platoon or squad battle task, or other collective task. Leaders perform a task crosswalk from this starting point to identify the supporting tasks at their echelon that best support the higher task. STEP 2: SELECT SUBORDINATE COLLECTIVE TASKS B-5. In this step, leaders identify the tasks at their echelon that best support the higher-level task. These tasks and their prioritization are then approved by the next higher echelon leader or commander to ensure proper mission nesting (when practicable, leaders select high-payoff tasks that support more than one mission- essential-task or battle task). The vignette illustrates the task crosswalk process. Task Crosswalk 14 June 2021 FM 7-0 B-3 Notional Task Crosswalk: Select Subordinate Collective Tasks Bravo company commander has selected the company mission-essential task, 07-CO-1073 Conduct a Movement to Contact - Rifle Company (SBCT), to train during the next field training exercise (FTX). The 1st platoon leader with input from the platoon sergeant selects the platoon battle tasks. These battle tasks and their prioritization are approved by the company commander to ensure proper nesting with the company mission-essential tasks. The resulting list of platoon battle tasks that the platoon leader then prioritizes for training might include—  07-PLT-1093 Conduct an Attack - Rifle Platoon (SBCT).  07-PLT-1198 Conduct a Mounted Tactical Road March - Platoon.  07-PLT-1082 Conduct a Forward Passage of Lines - Platoon.  07-PLT-0333 Conduct a Gap Crossing - Rifle Platoon (SBCT).  07-PLT-9013 Conduct Actions on Contact - Platoon. Noncommissioned officers train individuals, crews, and small teams. The noncommissioned officer in charge of the echelon selects collective tasks and battle drills for the echelon that best support the next echelon collective task or battle task. At the squad level for example, starting with the platoon task, 07-PLT-1093 Conduct an Attack - Rifle Platoon (SBCT), the squad leader prioritizes the following tasks the squad might train:  07-SQD-1092 Conduct an Attack – Squad.  07-SQD-3000 Conduct Support by Fire – Squad. STEP 3: SELECT INDIVIDUAL TASKS B-6. Noncommissioned officers at the lowest unit echelon select individual Soldier tasks that support their prioritized collective tasks. They select the appropriate tasks that when trained form the building blocks that allow Soldiers to execute collective training effectively at the next echelon. (When practical, leaders select high-payoff tasks that support more than one MET or battle task). The following vignette illustrates the squad leader’s selection of prioritized individual tasks. Notional Task Crosswalk: Select Individual Tasks The squad leader begins by selecting the squad task, 07-SQD-3000 Conduct Support by Fire - Squad. The leader then prioritizes the following individual tasks the squad might train:  071-COM-0501 Move as a Member of a Team.  071-326-5605 Control Movement of a Fire Team.  071-COM-0502 Move Under Direct Fire.  061-283-6003 Adjust Indirect Fire.

Individual training occurs in the institutional, operational, and self-development training domains. (See AR 350-1 and the Army Training Network (ATN) at https://atn.army.mil for training domains.) NESTING INDIVIDUAL TASKS TO BATTLE TASKS C-2. Units and individuals cannot train everything due to mission requirements and limitations in time and resources. Prioritizing individual tasks and nesting these to battle tasks ensure the tasks that individuals train support the collective tasks trained at higher echelons. At the lowest unit echelon (such as platoon, squad, team, and crew), noncommissioned officers (NCOs) ensure battle tasks nest to the individual tasks Soldiers train. Given the unit mission, time, and resources, NCOs select those individual tasks and battle drills that prioritize and focus Soldier training (when practicable, NCOs select high payoff tasks that support more than one battle task). Figure C-1 illustrates the concept of nesting individual tasks to battle tasks. (See appendix B for more information on task crosswalks.) Figure C-1. NCOs nest individual tasks to battle tasks SOLDIER SKILLS AND PROFICIENCIES C-3. The skills and proficiencies Soldiers train are the foundation to unit-level collective training. Proficient Soldiers enable their units to execute more complex collective tasks. Appendix C C-2 FM 7-0 14 June 2021 C-4. Figure C-2 illustrates how individual proficiencies form the basis for higher unit proficiency. NCOs prioritize individual training to the tasks that support small-unit battle tasks. In this way, unit mission- essential tasks nest to battle tasks and ultimately nest to individual tasks. Figure C-2. Individual training as cornerstone of unit training proficiency C-5. Soldier training is broad in scope. It ranges from training warrior tasks and battle drills, military occupational specialty (MOS) skills as well as weapons qualification for individual, crew-served, and platform-weapons proficiency. Unit NCOs and commanders continually train, track, and maintain these Soldier proficiencies to ensure the unit can perform its tasks to accomplish its mission. INDIVIDUAL TASKS C-6. An individual task is a clearly defined and measurable activity accomplished by a single person. Soldiers train individual tasks, both common and MOS. They are the lowest behavior or action in a job or duty that is performed. Individual task training and evaluation outlines (T&EOs) provide the detail of task performance and evaluation. INDIVIDUAL TRAINING C-7. Individual training consists of—  Army Warrior Training.  Individual critical task training.  Individual and crew-served weapons.  Holistic health and fitness (known as H2F) to include mental fitness and physical training. Individual Training 14 June 2021 FM 7-0 C-3 ARMY WARRIOR TRAINING C-8. Army Warrior Training consists of training select individual tasks and battle drills. Warrior tasks and battle drills (also referred to as WTBDs) enhance a Soldier’s individual readiness to fight on the battlefield. Warrior Tasks C-9. These individual tasks are common tasks for all Soldiers, regardless of MOS. Soldier training publications (listed as STPs) available at the Army Publishing Directorate website provide descriptions and details of these tasks. For example, the Soldier’s Manual of Common Tasks, Warrior Skills, Level 1 is STP 21-1-SMCT. Battle Drills C-10. Battle drills are tasks (individual and collective) designed to teach a Soldier or small unit to react and survive in common combat situations. A platoon, squad, team, or crew performs these actions when initiated by a predetermined cue (verbal or visual). Battle drills are performed instinctively; they require minimal leader direction and have little to no notice. When initiated they are considered vital to the success of the combat operation or critical to preserving life. Examples include tactical combat casualty care, react to contact, establish security at the halt, and react to ambush. INDIVIDUAL CRITICAL TASK TRAINING C-11. Individual critical task training consists of MOS tasks by skill level (1-4). MOS training ensures Soldiers achieve and sustain proficiency in their particular MOS. Soldiers and NCOs refer to Soldier training publications by MOS and skill level. For example, STP 17-19D1-SM-TG is for Soldiers with the MOS 19D who are training for Skill Level 1 proficiency. If there is no Soldier training publication published for specific MOS skills, Soldiers can find tasks on the MOS individual critical task list (known as ICTL) posted on the Central Army Registry website. INDIVIDUAL AND CREW-SERVED WEAPONS C-12. Soldiers train the individual and crew-served weapons they are assigned. Weapons qualification standards are published in the systems’ training circular available on the Army Publishing Directorate website. OTHER TYPES OF INDIVIDUAL TASKS C-13. In addition to Army warrior tasks and critical tasks, individuals or elements perform other type tasks. These are—  Leader tasks.  Opposing force (OPFOR) tasks.  Staff tasks. LEADER TASKS C-14. Leader tasks are those tasks specifically performed by leaders. They are organized by skill level at echelon (for example, captains and company first sergeants may perform the same tasks). Leader tasks are identified with ‘LDR’ in the task number. An example of a leader task is 150-LDR-5012 Conduct Troop Leading Procedures. OPPOSING FORCE TASKS C-15. OPFOR tasks are collective tasks that replicate the actions and activities a threat force would perform during an operation. While most OPFOR individual tasks mimic those of U.S. Soldier tasks, some OPFOR counter tasks do require unique supporting individual tasks. For example, emplacing an improvised explosive Appendix C C-4 FM 7-0 14 June 2021 device, operating as a member of an insurgency cell, and executing a terrorist attack. OPFOR tactics and capabilities representing global peer hybrid-threats are described in TC 7-100. STAFF TASKS C-16. Staff tasks are individual tasks performed by a unit staff member. Staff tasks are specified on the task’s T&EO. An example of a staff task is 171-300-0050 Perform Duties as a Member of a Battalion Staff. INDIVIDUAL TASK STANDARDS C-17. Standards for individual tasks are found in the task’s T&EO. Individual task T&EOs consist of task title, conditions, performance steps, and measures. These are developed and published by branch proponents. Individual tasks are available on the Army Training Network (ATN) at https://atn.army.mil. 14 June 2021 FM 7-0 D-1 Appendix D Training and Evaluation Outlines DEFINITION D-1. A training and evaluation outline is a summary document that provides performance and proficiency standards for individual and collective tasks. It provides information on individual or collective task training objectives, resource requirements, and evaluation procedures. Training and evaluation outlines (T&EOs) provide important training information that informs successful task execution. T&EOs are proponent developed and published. They are available on the following websites:  Army Training Network (ATN).  Combined Arms Training Strategies (CATS).  Digital Training Management System (DTMS).  Central Army Registry (CAR). (See the Army Training Network (ATN) at https://atn.army.mil for more on T&EOs.) PURPOSES D-2. T&EOs have three primary purposes:  Trainers use T&EOs to prepare and practice task execution.  Evaluators use T&EOs to observe and evaluate task performance.  Commanders use T&EOs to help assess collective task proficiency as part of feedback. D-3. Leaders use T&EOs to evaluate task proficiency. T&EOs specify the task type, the conditions under which the task is trained, and the standard to successfully perform the task. T&EOs also provide a wealth of task information to include the specific steps and measures taken as the task is performed. These outlines provide commanders essential feedback to help assess task proficiency. This page intentionally left blank. 14 June 2021 FM 7-0 E-1 Appendix E Training Meetings OVERVIEW E-1. Training meetings review training just conducted, discuss planning for future events, and provide a platform for the commander to issue training guidance. Additionally, training meetings facilitate the flow of training information and coordination among unit leaders. Training meeting how-to videos are available on the Army Training Network (ATN) at https://atn.army.mil. BRIGADE AND BATTALION TRAINING MEETINGS E-2. Regular Army and Reserve Component (RC) brigades serving on active duty conduct training meetings monthly and  battalions conduct training meetings (and training support meetings) each week or bi-weekly at a minimum. At these echelons, commanders refine mid-range training guidance, plans, and training calendars. They focus on overall long-range training plan progress and ensure training resources for subordinate organizations are resourced. Commanders also monitor and aggressively eliminate potential training distracters that may impede planned training. Attendees at these echelons include—  Commander.  Deputy commander (brigade-level, unit dependent).  Executive officer.  Command sergeant major.  Battalion commanders and command sergeants major (at brigade-level), and company commanders and first sergeants (at battalion level).  All primary coordinating staff (such as the personnel staff officer, intelligence staff officer, and operations staff officer).  Key staff officers and noncommissioned officers (NCOs).  Supporting and supported unit representatives.  Installation support representatives as required (such as the installation directorate of plans, training, mobilization and security). E-3. The agenda items covered at brigade and battalion training meetings include—  Training proficiency overview.  Training conducted (previous month).  Training planned and not conducted (and why).  Training highlights (to include training events for the next 45 days down to company level). Subordinate commanders in coordination with the operations staff officer nominate these highlights.  Installation training resource conferences scheduled for the next 60 to 90 days and the status of training resource requests.  Staff training projected for the next 45 days.  Leader development planning.  Issues affecting the resourcing of subordinate unit training.  Commander’s mid-range (semi-annual and quarterly) training guidance. Appendix E E-2 FM 7-0 14 June 2021 COMPANY TRAINING MEETINGS E-4. Company, troop, and battery training meetings are the center of gravity of unit training management. Regular Army and RC units serving on active duty conduct training meetings weekly. RC units conduct training meetings monthly. They occur at the same time every week or month and are routine to the company training schedule. Training and only training is discussed as demonstrated in the following vignette. Successful training meetings focus on—  Training proficiency overview.  Training just conducted (previous week). Subordinate feedback from training just conducted is critical to the commander to better assess the unit’s training proficiencies. The commander uses feedback to refine training plans and training guidance. Feedback includes—  Observations.  After action review results.  Completed evaluator training and evaluation outlines. (See chapter 5 for training and evaluation outlines.)  Other sources of feedback available to the commander.  The company’s leader development planning for training events focusing on leader development goals and objectives.  Mid-range planning and preparations (T-16 to T-7).  Short-range planning and preparations (T-6 to T) and commander’s short-range training guidance. Notional Company Training Meeting On Tuesday at 1300, Company B conducted its weekly training meeting. In attendance were the company commander, first sergeant, executive officer, supply sergeant, platoon leaders, and platoon sergeants. The company commander, CPT Angela Hawkins, began the meeting on time following a set agenda. She and the executive officer kept the meeting from straying to other issues and focused the meeting solely on company training. Last week, the company conducted a field training exercise (FTX). During this exercise, the company focused on one of its mission-essential tasks as a training objective—the collective task Occupy an Assembly Area. CPT Hawkins indicated that she previously assessed this task as a P proficiency rating. CPT Hawkins wanted to use the FTX to improve this assessment to a T proficiency rating. During the training meeting, the commander reviewed the feedback from the platoon leaders, the training and evaluation outlines provided by evaluators from company A, and her own observations. Based on this feedback, she assessed the company as a T proficiency rating for this task. Platoon leaders and sergeants stated that they conducted opportunity training during the FTX. They acknowledged the unit still needed to prioritize opportunity training plans to ensure resources and leader certifications were completed before training was conducted. CPT Hawkins emphasized that leaders needed to take every available opportunity to train Soldiers to improve individual skills. She stated that with limited training time, company leaders needed to take advantage of available time to improve these Soldier-level skills. Training Meetings 14 June 2021 FM 7-0 E-3 Attention then turned to coordination for upcoming events in the next six weeks. The executive officer pulled up the long-range training calendar to review these future events. The executive officer started with the company M4 qualifying range at Week T-6. He asked the range officer in charge, 1LT Johnson, to brief the status of this range. The lieutenant stated that the DA Form 581 (Request for Issue and Turn-In of Ammunition) was approved and that convoy clearances and driver certifications for the pick-up at the ammunition holding area were on track. He further stated that coordination with range control personnel had been conducted and a recon completed. The commander asked the platoon leaders for an update on their plans to run their platoons through a virtual weapons trainer prior to the range. Looking beyond 6 weeks, CPT Hawkins reviewed the training objectives for each major training event to make sure the company stays on track with the company long-range training plan. She provided additional planning guidance and emphasized to the platoon leaders that resource planning is vitally important at every step in the T-weeks leading up to any event. At 1430 hours, the commander concluded the company training meeting. PARTICIPANTS E-5. Leader participation is essential for a successful company training meeting. Paragraphs E-6 through E-14 specify the participants and their responsibilities. Company Commander E-6. The commander runs the training meeting and ensures the meeting agenda is followed. The commander begins the meeting by reviewing the current assessment of unit mission-essential tasks, reviews upcoming major training events, and reviews the organization’s training schedules. The commander provides short- range training guidance for upcoming events and confirms the status of requested training resources. Executive Officer E-7. In the absence of the commander, the executive officer runs the training meeting. This officer also coordinates training for all Soldiers in sections or attachments without platoon leaders or platoon sergeants. The executive officer provides the status of resources to support upcoming events and identifies resource issues affecting training. Additionally, the executive officer identifies any new resource requirements. First Sergeant E-8. The first sergeant reports on Soldier, crew, and small-team task proficiencies. The first sergeant provides guidance and advice on training plans and reviews pre-execution checks. Additionally, the first sergeant actively participates in the development of training plans for platoons (battle tasks and identification of resource requirements). The first sergeant advises the commander on the approval of individual Soldier tasks for planned opportunity training. The first sergeant also discusses the status of sergeant’s time training (known as STT). Platoon Leader E-9. Platoon leaders plan and manage platoon training.They provide feedback on training conducted and provide recommendations on future training events. Appendix E E-4 FM 7-0 14 June 2021 Platoon Sergeant E-10. Platoon sergeants assist their platoon leaders in planning and managing platoon training. In conjunction with their platoon leaders, they provide feedback on training conducted and provide recommendations on future training events. Key Staff Noncommissioned Officers E-11. Higher echelon staff NCOs attend training meetings as necessary. They advise the company commander on the status of specialized training. For example, the battalion master gunner works with the company master gunner and first sergeant to track individual and crew-served weapons qualifications and helps leaders with gunnery qualification requirements. Other key battalion or brigade NCOs identify and advise company leaders on opportunities to integrate specialized training into upcoming events. Supporting Maintenance Personnel E-12. Supporting maintenance personnel work with the commander and executive officer ensuring timely support is provided. Maintenance personnel provide input on the status of maintenance training, recommend maintenance training, and inform the commander of scheduled services and inspections that may impact training. Additionally, supporting maintenance personnel may advise the commander on maintenance training requirements. Supply Sergeant E-13. Supply sergeants provide input on supply-related issues, inspections, and inventories. Supply sergeants also work with the executive officer and first sergeant to coordinate necessary support from outside sources. They assist the executive officer and first sergeant in identifying, coordinating, and resourcing logistic support. Attached and Other Support Leaders E-14. Other leaders attend training meetings to coordinate their training efforts with those of the company. For example, the leader of an attached radar section may attend the meeting. Habitual attachments, such as medics or fire support personnel should also attend. These leaders provide their evaluation of tasks and battle drills previously trained. SCHEDULING TRAINING MEETINGS E-15. Commanders prioritize training meetings and conduct them on the same day and time each week. This regularity provides predictability to training. Company leaders conduct training meetings in any environment—at home station or deployed. They are also conducted regardless of the time management cycle the unit is in (green, amber, or red). E-16. Leaders consider several factors before selecting a time to conduct training meetings. Main considerations include—  Enabling leaders to attend.  Minimizing training disruptions.  Allowing subordinate leaders time to prepare.  Adhering to local policy. E-17. RC commanders should conduct training meetings during regularly scheduled drill periods unless the commander designates otherwise. PLATOON TRAINING MEETINGS E-18. Platoon leaders conduct platoon training meetings to coordinate the training efforts of the platoon. Platoon meetings have three objectives: Training Meetings 14 June 2021 FM 7-0 E-5  Gather information from subordinate leaders on the training proficiency of battle tasks, Soldier individual tasks, and battle drill proficiencies.  Discuss preparations for upcoming training.  Solicit ideas for future training requirements. E-19. Platoon training meetings are organized like company training meetings, only less formal in nature. They are conducted every week (every month for RC) prior to the company training meeting and generally last no more than 30 minutes. A typical list of attendees for a platoon meeting include—  Platoon leader.  Platoon sergeant.  Squad leaders.  Section, team, or crew leaders. E-20. The platoon sergeant ensures that all NCOs are prepared for the meeting. This means everyone is on time and properly equipped. At a minimum, NCOs come prepared and bring the following:  Leader book.  Paper and writing utensil.  Training schedules.  Calendar. Agenda E-21. Platoons follow an agenda allowing for a quick and efficient meeting. An example of a platoon training meeting agenda includes—  Squad training situation report (SITREP).  Platoon leader’s training SITREP.  Preparations for training.  Future training.  Platoon training guidance.  Opportunity training focus areas. Squad or Section Training Situation Report E-22. Squad leaders give the platoon leader their current training SITREP since the last platoon meeting. The report focuses on the current proficiencies of squad or section battle tasks. This does not need to be an elaborate briefing. Since the platoon leader normally attends all training, squad leaders only have to highlight what went right and what went wrong for the squad. E-23. The purpose of the squad or section training SITREP is to get honest input directly from the first-line leader. If the squad can perform tasks to standard, then the leader needs to state that during the discussion. If the squad leader feels the squad cannot perform a task to standard, then the leader needs to state that. The squad or section leader must establish an atmosphere of open dialogue. Platoon Leader’s Training Evaluation E-24. Once done with squad SITREPs, the platoon leader provides an evaluation as a SITREP of the platoon battle tasks that support the company’s prioritized mission-essential tasks. This evaluation includes platoon weapon systems proficiencies. This SITREP is based on squad evaluations, personal observations, and discussions with the platoon sergeant. Other leaders then update their leader books with the appropriate new entry for battle task and weapons proficiency. Elements of the platoon training SITREP include—  Current platoon battle task, weapons qualification, and collective task proficiencies.  A plan to improve or sustain as necessary. Appendix E E-6 FM 7-0 14 June 2021 Planning for Training E-25. After the platoon leader has developed and received approval for a training plan, the platoon leader and platoon sergeant see that the platoon thoroughly plans for and executes training. In this capacity, the platoon sergeant must personally ensure pre-execution checks are completed and that nothing that could affect the quality of the training is left to chance. To prepare for quality training, the platoon sergeant ensures that NCOs—  Prepare themselves.  Prepare the training resources training aids, devices, simulators, and simulations (known as TADSS).  Prepare training support personnel (such as the opposing forces).  Prepare their Soldiers (prerequisite training). E-26. Much of this review is discussed one-on-one between the platoon sergeant and the primary NCO trainer. However, during the platoon meeting, squad leaders brief specifics of their training covering at a minimum—  Key pre-execution checks.  Rehearsal plan.  “Homework” requirements.  Any unresolved issues. Platoon sergeants maintain the tempo of the meeting by prompting squad leaders with questions and suggestions on the training being discussed. Like training meetings at other echelons, platoon sergeants keep the meeting from straying to other issues and focus it solely on platoon training. Platoon Training Guidance E-27. Although command guidance is generally passed to subordinates as soon as it is received, the platoon meeting is a good time for a recap. The platoon leader briefs new training guidance or command directives. The platoon sergeant then covers any specific guidance from the first sergeant or command sergeant major. Opportunity Training Focus Areas E-28. Platoon leaders use platoon training meetings to obtain input from subordinate leaders on tasks that require improvement or need to be sustained. Opportunity training gives leaders confidence that they are using their training time more effectively and efficiently. The following vignette illustrates an opportunity training scenario. Notional Opportunity Training In preparation for an upcoming small-arms range, 2LT Pat Rogers and SFC Jamie Rodriguez (platoon leader and platoon sergeant, 3d Platoon) realize there will likely be ‘down-time’ while their Soldiers are at the range complex. They know they can use opportunity training as a way to keep their Soldiers engaged during inactive periods at the range—and to improve or sustain individual skills. As they are planning the range, 2LT Rogers and SFC Rodriguez ask their squad leaders to review their echelon’s battle tasks and determine which of their prioritized individual tasks should be trained while at the range. The leaders identify the following tasks for opportunity training: 150-AWT-1002 Employ Hand Grenade and 081-831- 1026 Perform First Aid for an Open Chest Wound. 2LT Rogers and SFC Rodriguez agree with these individual tasks. 2LT Rogers then includes his platoon’s opportunity training plan as part of the briefing to the company commander on how the platoon will conduct the range and gains the commander’s approval. Training Meetings 14 June 2021 FM 7-0 E-7 Back at the platoon area, the platoon leader and platoon sergeant ensure their squad leaders are using the 8-step training model to prepare for the range and their opportunity training.  Step 1—Plan the training event. All squad leaders plan how they will train their squad on the individual tasks during hip-pocket training and then backbrief 2LT Rogers and SFC Rodriguez.  Step 2—Train and certify leaders. Squad leaders are trained and then certified by SFC Rodriguez in accordance with the leader certification criteria established by the company commander.  Step 3—Recon the training site. During the platoon leadership’s reconnaissance of the range, space is designated for opportunity training.  Step 4—Issue the operation order (OPORD). The platoon leader issues the platoon plan for conducting the range, including the execution of opportunity training.  Step 5—Rehearse. Each squad leader rehearses their opportunity training plan prior to the execution of the range.  Step 6—Train. Squad leaders make maximum use of available training time by executing opportunity training during down time on the range. The squad leaders evaluate and record their Soldiers’ proficiency in tasks trained during opportunity training.  Step 7—Conduct after action reviews (AARs). Each squad leader conducts an internal AAR with their squad on the conduct of the hip-pocket training. A final AAR is then conducted with the squad leaders and platoon leadership in order to identify areas to sustain and improve for future opportunity training.  Step 8—Retrain. Squad leaders retrain their Soldiers on the individual tasks that were not performed to standard during opportunity training. While at the range, the platoon is notified that there will be a delay before they are called forward to the firing line. Leaders at all levels immediately recognize a good opportunity to fill that time with their programmed opportunity training. The squad leaders review the task title, conditions, and standards for each task with their squads. They then demonstrate task execution for each task, focusing on the performance steps and measures to perform each task correctly. The squad leaders then have each Soldier perform the tasks and evaluate each Soldier’s performance on the corresponding task’s training and evaluation outline (T&EO). After each squad has performed the tasks and their squad leaders are satisfied their squads can perform the tasks to standard, they conduct an internal AAR. 2LT Rogers and SFC Rodriguez then conduct a platoon-level AAR reviewing what to sustain and how the platoon can better perform the tasks better during future training events. Tips for a Successful Meeting E-29. Good, efficient meetings come in many shapes and forms. The following techniques apply to all types of platoons, both Regular Army and RC:  Conduct the meeting at the same time and place each week and make attendance mandatory.  Enforce the use of leader books.  Listen when time to listen.  Confirm the status of upcoming training events (pre-combat checks and pre-combat inspections). Appendix E E-8 FM 7-0 14 June 2021  Do not wait until the meeting to conduct essential coordination.  Focus on training issues and leave administrative details until after the meeting. MANAGE TRAINING EVENTS E-30. Training events can be managed using the T-Week framework. This is a planning technique that identifies actions and activities to accomplish prior to each training event. T-Week is the week of training execution; T-6 represents activities six weeks prior to execution. Table E-1 illustrates a sample T-Week calendar and associated actions. Units develop and tailor their own T-week actions and timelines based on local command and installation requirements. Table E-1. T-Week calendar Weeks to training Activities T-16 Identify major training facilities Week T-12 Conduct training event planning Week T-11 Refine event requirements Week T-10 Begin pre-execution checks Week T-9 Confirm resource requests Week T-8 Execute reconnaissance and confirm resources Week T-7 Publish the training event orders Week T-6* Review and complete deliberate risk assessments Week T-5 Complete tactical plan and supporting products Week T-4 Conduct certifications and complete prerequisite training Week T-3 Conduct rehearsals Week T-2 Finalize support and conduct OPFOR rehearsal Week T-1 Draw equipment or supplies and execute subordinate rehearsals and checks T Week Execute training Week T+1 Recover, and conduct final after action reviews *Training schedule approved and published at T-6 OPFOR   opposing force Note. RC units should aggregate activities based on their monthly schedule. TRAINING RESOURCE TRACKING E-31. Tracking training resources using the T-Week framework is key to coordinating and managing the actions necessary to ensure training resources are available when training begins. Assigning responsibility for and tracking each training resource requires constant attention. Figure E-1 is an example of a unit training resource tracking technique. A notional training resource vignette begins on page E-10. Training Meetings 14 June 2021 FM 7-0 E-9 Figure E-1. Sample unit training resource tracker Appendix E E-10 FM 7-0 14 June 2021 Notional Training Resource Charlie Company, 3d Transportation Battalion is two months out (T-8) from its next company field training exercise (FTX). At the company’s weekly training meeting, CPT Janet Sprague wants to ensure resource planning and coordination is on track. She asks the company executive officer, 1LT Brian Jones, to provide a T-Week breakdown of the coordination that has been done and what still needs to be accomplished. CPT Sprague wants to make sure there are no gaps in planning and preparation. She knows from experience that if resources have not been correctly requested then the company may not be able to execute the FTX as planned. CPT Sprague goes over the company’s training objectives for the FTX. She highlights the two company mission-essential tasks that are prioritized for training. She also confirms that her platoon leaders understand that their platoon battle tasks for the FTX need to be nested with these company mission-essential tasks (METs). She reiterates the responsibility for her platoon leaders to thoroughly review their platoon-level task training and evaluation outlines (T&EOs) for their prioritized platoon battle tasks. The company first sergeant, 1SG Alex Rodriguez, reminds the platoon leaders and platoon sergeants that the T&EOs contain the standards their platoons will be evaluated on during the company FTX. 1SG Rodriguez also reminds the platoon sergeants to ensure their squad leaders’ battle tasks are correctly prioritized and nested with the platoon battle tasks and that the individual tasks prioritized for training during the FTX are also properly nested to the squad battle tasks. CPT Sprague then reminds the group that in accordance with their company’s standard operating procedure (SOP), she will review the platoon leaders’ recommended platoon and squad battle tasks as well as the nested individual tasks at their Week T-6 training meeting. CPT Sprague then asks 1LT Drew Jones to provide an overview of the FTX resource status beginning with T-8. 1LT Jones reports: T-8: Training area reconnaissance is scheduled for Thursday of this week. These recons ensure leaders have physically been to the training areas and facilities supporting the FTX.These reconnaissance visits also help identify any previously overlooked resources and other issues including security issues, traffic control, and possible convoy route concerns. 1LT Jones runs down a few key questions leaders must be able to answer at the conclusion of their training area reconnaissance:  Does the terrain support the company’s training objectives?  Are there safety-related environmental factors (flash flood area, electric hazards, or wildlife)?  Are there any local policy restrictions on transporting personnel and equipment to or from the training site that would affect training?  Medical evacuation considerations? 1LT Jones then hands out a consolidated list of training area reconnaissance questions for company leaders to consider while conducting the training area reconnaissance. This list is used as a template for each company-level training event and is updated after each FTX. It was most recently refined during the after action review (AAR) of the company’s last FTX. 1LT Jones then reviews the status of the resources that have been identified and requested through the battalion (BN) logistics staff officer (S-4) for the FTX. Training Meetings 14 June 2021 FM 7-0 E-11 Class Status I (rations) Amber (requirements acknowledged by BN S-4) III (POL: petroleum, oils, Amber (POL requirements submitted to BN S-4) and lubricants) IV (construction materials) Green (materials on hand) V (ammunition) Amber (DA Form 581 [Request for Issue and Turn-In of Ammunition] submitted to BN) VIII (medical) Green (BN medical support will be on site) CPT Sprague reiterates that without resources coordinated early, they will not be available at the start of training. Resources are a critical component to a challenging and effective FTX. T-7: CPT Sprague issues the FTX order. She specified the company’s training objectives, her intent, and details of logistic support and leader responsibilities. She also includes details on the company’s evaluation plan and leader development plan. T-6: CPT Sprague provides a signed training schedule to LTC Taylor Greene, her battalion commander. Once the training schedule is signed, training is protected from training distracters. CPT Sprague knows that any significant modifications to her signed training schedule requires battalion commander level approval for changes between Weeks T-6 through T-4, brigade commander level approval for changes between Weeks T-3 through T-2, and division commander level approval for any changes inside Week T-1. She recalls her brigade commander telling her during her initial counseling that consistent changes within two weeks of training indicate a failure to accurately plan unit training or protect it from un-forecasted distracters. T-5: Complete supporting plans and products. These include the tactical plan, opposing force (OPFOR) plan (if required), master scenario events list (MSEL), evaluation plan, and leader development plan. Platoon leaders complete a risk assessment to include DD Form 2977 (Deliberate Risk Assessment Worksheet) and submit it to CPT Sprague for review and approval. Platoon leaders will brief their plans to mitigate any safety risk prior to the FTX. Subsequently, CPT Sprague then completes a DD Form 2977 for the company and provides it to LTC Greene for approval. T-4: Leader certifications are completed. This includes the certifications for (not limited to) leaders, weapons, equipment, ranges, and the OPFOR required to conduct the FTX. Certification is a measure of individual, crew, or team technical proficiency. T-3: Leaders and Soldiers are prepared and rehearsals conducted. CPT Sprague emphasizes the value of rehearsals:  Identify weak points in the plan.  Teach effective training techniques.  Coach trainers until they feel comfortable.  Ensure safety and environmental considerations are met and updated.  Determine if subordinate leaders are tactically and technically proficient.  Determine how leaders will evaluate Soldier and unit performance.  Evaluate subordinate leader competencies and provide feedback.  Give subordinates confidence in their ability to train or operate. Appendix E E-12 FM 7-0 14 June 2021 T-2: Finalize support. Check and double check resource ordering and availability for the exercise. T-1: Draw equipment and supplies, execute final rehearsals and checks, conduct communications and connectivity checks, ensure training aids, devices, simulators, and simulations (TADSS) (to include multiple integrated laser engagement system, or MILES, equipment) are on hand or ready for pick-up, and conduct final training area or facility coordination. T Week: Conduct pre-combat checks and pre-combat inspections, execute the FTX (shoot, move, communicate, and survive), conduct informal AARs as necessary, evaluate training, and at end of exercise conduct sensitive items checks, redeploy to company area, and recover personnel and equipment. Post operations checks are conducted. T+1: Conduct final AARs (commander reviews feedback or evaluations), assess training objectives or update company MET assessments, review and update company and platoon tactical SOPs, and record training results. 1LT Jones completes the T-Week run-down of FTX planning and opens the discussion for comments. CPT Sprague and 1SG Rodriguez discuss the importance of opportunity training when the unit has training downtime during the FTX. CPT Sprague states that training time is precious and hip-pocket training is an important way to improve and sustain individual training proficiencies when time is available. At 1400 hours, CPT Sprague concludes the training meeting. SITUATIONAL TRAINING EXERCISE E-32. As a short, limited exercise, a situational training exercise (known as STX) is driven by scenarios and missions. Situational training exercises are designed to train one collective task, or a group of related tasks or battle drills, through practice. The following vignette illustrates how training meetings facilitate the coordination and planning of a company situational training exercise. Training Meetings 14 June 2021 FM 7-0 E-13 Notional Situational Training Exercise CPT Ronald Jackson, commander of Company C, 1-78th IN, during the development of his company’s long-range training plan, determined that the company must prioritize company training on his company’s prioritized mission-essential task list (METL) task 07-CO-1092 Conduct an Attack - Rifle Company. His annual training plan was subsequently briefed to the brigade commander at the annual training briefing (ATB) and approved. He then published his annual training guidance (ATG), which included guidance to the platoon leaders that the platoon-level training during a designated training time would focus on platoon battle task 07-PLT-1092 Conduct an Attack and that the platoon-level training would culminate with a conduct an attack situational training exercise (STX). CPT Jackson allocated training time and resources for platoon level STXs to position the company to achieve a T proficiency rating in this prioritized mission-essential task (MET) as well as master designated platoon-level battle tasks. He knows that conducting platoon level STXs prior to the company field training exercise will position the company to achieve a T proficiency rating in this prioritized MET. CPT Jackson also knows that according to FM 7-0 and his own personal experience, STXs are ideal for this training because they are task-based, limited exercises designed to train a collective task, or a group of related tasks and drills—in this case the platoon battle task, Conduct an Attack. As the training approaches, CPT Jackson reviews the training event during the weekly company training meeting to ensure proper planning and resourcing of the training event. He emphasizes that each platoon leader must review the standards for this training and evaluation outline (T&EO) as well as understand the criteria it will take to achieve a T proficiency rating. He reiterates the importance of executing the nested individual tasks and lower echelon battle tasks to standard during the execution of platoon STX because they are the building blocks of higher echelon training. CPT Jackson also noted that this STX was a great opportunity for leader development. While he would be evaluating the performance of the platoon leaders, each platoon leader must have a solid plan to evaluate their subordinate leaders. Task 07-PLT-1092 has several steps identified as Leader Steps and will provide excellent opportunities for them to work on leader skills within the platoon when executing this task. He reminded them that FM 6-22 was the Army’s doctrine for leader development and encouraged them to review it prior to the STX. As a general scheme of maneuver for both the dry-fire and live-fire phases of the STX, CPT Jackson reviews the general maneuver graphic: Appendix E E-14 FM 7-0 14 June 2021 CPT Jackson directs that platoons receiving a ‘NO-GO’ in the dry-fire phase by evaluators at the AAR site will move to a designated retraining site before attempting the task again. Platoons receiving a ‘GO’ by evaluators will repeat the task but under more challenging conditions as specified by the chief evaluator. He states that his guidance is to continue training the task until task mastery is achieved. At his discretion, platoons successfully performing the task under varied conditions will move to the live-fire assembly area for further guidance and briefings by range safety personnel prior to the issuance of live ammunition. CPT Jackson’s executive officer, 1LT Blake Gilford, states that platoon leaders are encouraged to review and plan their STXs based on FM 7-0, Appendix G, “Lane Training,” to better understand the general sequence of events and to recon training area 37 where the platoon STXs will be executed. 1LT Gilford reminds each platoon leader to follow the 8-step training model as they plan and prepare their platoon STX. As a review, he briefly covers each step:  Step 1: Plan the training event.  Step 2: Train and certify leaders.  Step 3: Recon training sites.  Step 4: Issue the operation order (OPORD).  Step 5: Rehearse.  Step 6: Train.  Step 7: Conduct after action reviews (AARs).  Step 8: Retrain. CPT Jackson indicates that at the conclusion of each platoon STX, he will review all feedback, especially the T&EOs by the external evaluators, to assess the proficiency of each platoon in the battle task and record the results. 14 June 2021 FM 7-0 F-1 Appendix F Training Exercises OVERVIEW F-1. Training exercises are scenario driven, multiechelon, multi-task training events. When an exercise cannot be conducted in a live environment, the commander considers using virtual, constructive, or mixed training environments to achieve training objectives. (See the Army Training Network (ATN) at https://atn.army.mil for more on training environments.) TYPES OF TRAINING EXERCISES F-2. There are fifteen foundational Army training exercises. Additionally, unit commanders develop and tailor training exercises based on training objectives and the needs of the unit. See table F-1 for the types of exercises and their abbreviations. Table F-1. Training exercises Exercise name Exercise abbreviation combined arms live-fire exercise CALFEX command post exercise CPX communications exercise COMMEX deployment exercise DEPEX emergency deployment readiness exercise EDRE external evaluation EXEVAL field training exercise FTX fire coordination exercise FCX live-fire exercise LFX map exercise MAPEX mission readiness exercise MRE situational training exercise STX staff exercise STAFFEX tactical exercise without troops TEWT warfighter exercise WFX COMBINED ARMS LIVE-FIRE EXERCISE F-3. A combined arms live-fire exercise (known as CALFEX) is a maneuver exercise that trains and evaluates a unit’s ability to maneuver and integrate direct and indirect fires. In this resource-intensive exercise, units shoot, move, communicate, and survive while employing organic and supporting weapon systems using full-caliber ammunition. (See appendix I for more on the combined arms live-fire exercise.) COMMAND POST EXERCISE F-4. The command post exercise (known as CPX) is a multiechelon exercise focused on tasks supporting communications, command and control systems, and procedures. Units conduct a command post exercise in garrison or field locations, replicating an operational environment using a tactical scenario. The command Appendix F F-2 FM 7-0 14 June 2021 post exercise physically replicates actual operational distances between command posts and systems as much as practical. F-5. During a command post exercise, operations are continuous and use all organic and supporting communications equipment. Commanders practice combined arms integration, tactical movement, emplacement, and displacement of command posts. Each headquarters practice survivability operations such as dispersion, camouflage, and security based on the flow and demands of the tactical scenario. Command post exercises also train and evaluate staff battle task proficiency. COMMUNICATIONS EXERCISE F-6. A communications exercise (known as COMMEX) is an exercise to employ and test communications equipment and to train commanders and staffs, communications personnel, and small-unit leaders in command, control, and communications (known as C3) procedures. The communications exercise stresses communications discipline, traffic flow, and the proper selection of message precedence and communications means. It often employs reduced distances between communications nodes. DEPLOYMENT EXERCISE F-7. A deployment exercise (known as DEPEX) is an exercise to train tasks and procedures for deploying Soldiers and units from home stations or installations to potential areas of employment. It includes the participation of associated installation support agencies. See also paragraph F-8 for emergency deployment readiness exercises. EMERGENCY DEPLOYMENT READINESS EXERCISE F-8. An emergency deployment readiness exercise (known as EDRE) is a minimum-notice exercise to test unit deployment capabilities for contingency operations. Emergency deployment readiness exercises are conducted at the company level or higher. Commanders vary the scope and complexity of emergency deployment readiness exercises based on mission, time, resources, and training objectives. One option is a full-scale exercise. In it, units move deployable equipment to staging areas and load equipment and personnel aboard air, rail, or sea transport (these are often simulated using installation resources like railheads and aircraft mock-ups). F-9. Another option is for no equipment to move. Instead, personnel report to designated locations for coordination and for any necessary activities short of moving equipment. Deployment procedures are also exercised with facilities that simulate deployment processing agencies. For example, medical personnel and transportation stations as required by the scenario may be set up in a large gymnasium. Designated personnel representing the deploying unit and participating agencies report to the proper station to coordinate activities. In such environments, emergency deployment readiness exercises are conducted like map exercises using operational scenarios, maps, and appropriate tactical sketches. EXTERNAL EVALUATION F-10. External evaluations (known as EXEVALs) are scenario-driven evaluations of a unit’s training proficiency conducted by leaders from outside the evaluated unit’s chain of command. The commander two levels above the evaluated unit directs and resources the external evaluation. External evaluations include all organic and attached personnel and units at the echelon of evaluation. (See appendix H for more on external evaluations.) FIELD TRAINING EXERCISE F-11. Field training exercises (known as FTXs) are task-based simulated, tactical operations in a live-field environment against an actual or simulated opposing force. They exercise entire echelons (platoon, company, battalion, or brigade) to include all organic and attached personnel and units. Field training exercises are resource-intense exercises that rely on detailed planning, coordination, and execution. Training Exercises 14 June 2021 FM 7-0 F-3 FIRE COORDINATION EXERCISE F-12. The fire coordination exercise (known as FCX) is a live-fire exercise that trains and evaluates a unit’s ability to integrate direct and indirect fires. A fire coordination exercise is a reduced-force exercise; full- caliber ammunitions may be substituted with sub-caliber munitions or devices. F-13. The fire coordination exercise can be conducted at platoon, company or team, battalion or task force, and brigade levels. Additionally, the fire coordination exercise trains unit leadership by integrating available organic weapon systems, to include indirect and supporting fires. (See appendix I for fire coordination.) LIVE-FIRE EXERCISE F-14.A live-fire exercise (known as LFX) trains and evaluates a unit’s ability to coordinate and control more than one weapon system to deliver direct or indirect fires using full-caliber munitions. Sub-caliber munitions may be used when appropriate. Live-fire exercises train unit movement or maneuver and the employment of organic and supporting weapon systems. These exercises include the integration of all logistic support. A live-fire exercise should test the ability of the unit’s chain of command to control and distribute fires effectively. Live-fire exercises require demonstrated proficiency at lower echelons before conducted at higher echelons. (See appendix I for more on live-fire training.) MAP EXERCISE F-15. The map exercise (known as MAPEX) is a leader and staff training exercise using maps and digital displays portraying tactical scenarios. They provide a training opportunity providing commanders a technique to train their staffs in performing essential integrating and control functions without deploying the unit. Note. A rehearsal of concept (known as ROC) drill is a map exercise sub-category. Commanders use a rehearsal of concept drill to synchronize, align, and coordinate an exercise using maps, overlays, terrain models, or sand tables at the tactical level. MISSION READINESS EXERCISE F-16. A mission readiness exercise (known as MRX) is a command and staff-level command post exercise conducted as a culminating training event for deploying divisions and corps with subordinate brigade-level headquarters. SITUATIONAL TRAINING EXERCISE F-17. Situational training exercises (known as STXs) are task-based, limited exercises designed to train a collective task or a group of related tasks and drills. They usually include drills, leader tasks, and Soldier tasks. The situational training exercise provides the leader a method to train using doctrinally approved tactics and techniques, but unlike a battle drill, does not prescribe a method of execution. Situational training exercises may be modified to meet mission requirements, but are evaluated based on standards found in applicable task training and evaluation outlines. STAFF EXERCISE F-18. A staff exercise (known as STAFFEX) trains unit staffs to perform tasks essential to command and control planning, coordination, integration, synchronization, and control functions under simulated operational conditions. A battalion and above exercise, the staff exercise also trains staffs to function as an effective team exchanging information, sharing knowledge, preparing estimates, giving appraisals, making recommendations, preparing orders, issuing orders, and coordinating execution of orders. Staff training develops and sustains planning, coordination, and other staff functions related to mission requirements. Staff exercises are used to evaluate staff battle task proficiency. Appendix F F-4 FM 7-0 14 June 2021 TACTICAL EXERCISE WITHOUT TROOPS F-19. A tactical exercise without troops (known as TEWT) is a low-cost, low-overhead exercise conducted in the field on actual terrain for training units for specific mission requirements while considering potential threat actions. Minimal troop and support personnel conduct the exercise as leaders and staff analyze unit actions, weapon emplacement, and operation planning. Leaders also use tactical exercises without troops to coach subordinates on the best use of the terrain and proper employment of combined arms assets. WARFIGHTER EXERCISE F-20. A warfighter exercise (known as WFX) is a distributed, simulation driven, multiechelon tactical command post exercise. It places an organization against a live, free-thinking adversary and is designed to train and rehearse units. Warfighter exercises are directed by Headquarters, Department of the Army, scheduled by FORSCOM, and conducted by TRADOC training programs. 14 June 2021 FM 7-0 G-1 Appendix G Lane Training OVERVIEW G-1. Lane training is a company and below training technique to train individual and collective tasks and drills consisting of activities conducted sequentially from an assembly area, rehearsal, execution, after action review (AAR), and retraining. This training technique can be as simple as training a single individual task or as complex as training several collective tasks using a tactical scenario. Lane training may include more than one lane, each lane focusing on executing specific tasks or drills. Lane training can be tailored to unit training needs and training objectives. G-2. Lane training can be conducted in a designated area or facility. The unit trained operates from a stationary position, or tactically moves over designated terrain (lane) executing selected tasks observed by an evaluator. The focus of lane training is on small-unit task proficiency. At the small-unit level, lane training is extremely effective and allows unlimited repetitions of tasks or drills until proficiency is achieved. (See the Army Training Network (ATN) at https://atn.army.mil for more information on lane training.) G-3. The primary advantages of lane training are—  It requires limited space to execute tasks.  The training environment is unit controlled.  Tasks are based on unit proficiency requirements and training objectives.  Feedback of performance is immediate. G-4. Lane training enables leaders to—  Focus training on specific training objectives.  Train similar units—simultaneously or sequentially—using mission-related scenarios.  Test, standardize, and train unit tactics, techniques, and procedures.  Support initial training and retraining.  Vary training conditions to the training level of the unit and leaders.  Achieve proficiency when resources and time are limited (including land, facilities, personnel, and equipment).  Prepare for internal and external evaluations.  Conduct unit competitions. LANE TRAINING ACTIVITIES G-5. There are five basic activities that occur in the conduct of a lane. These are executed sequentially and consist of assembly, rehearsal, execution, AAR, and retraining. These activities are described in table G-1 on page G-2. Appendix G G-2 FM 7-0 14 June 2021 Table G-1. Lane training activities Assembly Activities involving unit in-briefing, leader preparation, and troop leading procedures (including issuance of the unit’s OPORD). These activities are normally conducted in an AA. Rehearsal Activities involving practices of unit tasks to be performed on the lane (or to execute for the OPORD), normally at a crawl or walk speed. These practices may take place in rehearsal areas, in AAs, or on lanes. Execution Activities required to perform specific individual or collective tasks on the lane (or to execute for the OPORD), normally at a run speed. These activities may take place on a lane. AAR Activities required to provide—  A structured, interactive, group-oriented review and evaluation of the unit’s task performance on the execution lane.  Suggestions on how to improve future performance. These activities usually take place in an AAR area or on a lane. Retraining Activities required to enable the unit to perform lane tasks to the required standards. These activities normally take place in a retraining area, rehearsal area, or on a lane. AA assembly area OPORD operation order AAR after action review G-6. A graphic of these activities is depicted in figure G-1. Figure G-1. Lane activities graphic Lane Training 14 June 2021 FM 7-0 G-3 G-7.

The vignette beginning on page G-4 illustrates how lane training can be unit tailored to achieve a variety of training objectives. Appendix G G-4 FM 7-0 14 June 2021 Notional Lane Training Phases Battery B, 2d Battalion, 45th Field Artillery is conducting lane training. CPT Kennedy Rogers, battery commander, wants to take a crawl-walk-run approach to this event by conducting it in three phases (lanes). In addition to validating gun crew certifications and improving proficiency in a key battle task (06-PLT-5424 Process Fire Missions), CPT Rogers will use the lane training to develop platoon task mastery by changing the conditions under which the task is performed. He also wants to use this training event as a friendly competition among the platoons. Phase one (crawl). Lane #1 training objective is to verify each platoon’s howitzer section certifications. Each platoon will move to a stationary lane where certified evaluators from Battery C will provide both a written and hands-on evaluation of each gun crew’s proficiency. The platoon certification is validated when all sections are evaluated ‘GO’. If one section is a ‘NO-GO,’ the platoon is a ‘NO-GO’ and must retrain and repeat the lane until all sections are a ‘GO.’ See figure G-2. Figure G-2. Lane #1, stationary lane Lane Training 14 June 2021 FM 7-0 G-5 Phase two (walk). Lane #2 will be conducted to evaluate each platoon’s proficiency to conduct a dry-fire mission task (06-PLT-5424 Process Fire Missions). In this phase, each platoon will move tactically through a second lane to a designated firing position. While moving, the platoon operations center (POC) or fire direction center (FDC) will generate and transmit firing data to the platoon. The platoon will occupy a tactical position and process the fire mission—proficiency will be evaluated based on the platoon meeting time and safety standards for the task and the type mission. If standards are met, the platoon is a ‘GO’ and can proceed as directed to lane #3. If the platoon fails to meet standards with a ‘NO-GO,’ it retrains and re-enters lane #2. See figure G-3. Figure G-3. Lane #2, dry-fire lane Appendix G G-6 FM 7-0 14 June 2021 Phase three (run). Lane #3 will be conducted to evaluate each platoons proficiency to conduct dry-fire missions task (06-PLT-5424 Process Fire Missions) but under changing conditions as proficiency improves. CPT Rogers wants each platoon to achieve what FM 7-0 discusses as task mastery—to be proficient in processing fire missions as the tactical situation is steadily degraded with changing conditions. Similar to lane #2, each platoon will move tactically to a designated firing position and process fire missions while lane evaluators change the conditions. First, they will remove the platoon leader. Then evaluators will create a loss of digital fire control at the FDC (the platoon will have to demonstrate the ability to compute firing data manually). Lastly, the evaluators will add enemy counterfire artillery. CPT Rogers believes that by introducing these changing conditions, the platoons will ultimately master the ability to process fire missions under the most stressful conditions—and improve their confidence. He expects it will take several iterations of lane #3 before each platoon will achieve a ‘GO.’ If the platoon is a ‘GO,’ it will be directed to the installation wash rack and then to the battery motor pool for recovery. See figure G-4. Figure G-4. Lane #3, changing conditions Lane Training 14 June 2021 FM 7-0 G-7 The following day, CPT Rogers reviews all completed evaluator training and evaluation outlines. He also conducts an office call with the evaluators and AAR facilitators to discuss their observations and personal comments. He also considers his own observations and experiences as part of overall feedback. He then discusses the results of the lane training with the battery first sergeant and battalion commander, LTC Jordan Short. Following the dialogue between the two commanders, LTC Short presents 2d platoon the Best Howitzer Platoon trophy. G-9. This vignette demonstrates the flexibility and innovative ways leaders can use lane training to tailor training to deliver challenging and effective training. Using lane training, small-unit leaders can train effectively at low cost in less time and with fewer resources to achieve task proficiency. LANE SUPPORT G-10. Depending on the scale and scope of the lanes, support can be minimal, or it can be extensive especially at the platoon level. The greater the needs of the training area and the need to replicate an operational environment, the more complex is the support required to run lanes. For platoon-level lanes, the company can provide a small command and control node to—  Replicate higher headquarters for scenario and tactical support.  Provide support facilities as necessary, like medical aid stations, Class I and Class III supply points, and other administrative support. LANE REFERENCE DOCUMENTATION G-11. Developing lane training can take substantial time and resources to coordinate. Since they are recurring training events, unit staffs record planning and preparing these events for future use. Units use three types of lane training documentation:  Lane training support package.  Lane handbook.  Evaluator handbook. LANE TRAINING SUPPORT PACKAGE G-12. A lane training support package provides a standard, unit-developed product that reduces the training development workload by preparing a product one time and using it repeatedly. They are locally developed and compiled by the organizing unit. For a lane exercise that includes multiple lanes, each lane evaluator develops a lane handbook for each lane. LANE HANDBOOK G-13. Lane handbooks provide general information and guidance applicable to all lanes. Lane evaluators develop handbooks tailored to lane support, execution, and training objectives. Unit leaders determine the contents of the lane handbook. Lane evaluators provide this material to the training unit prior to the scheduled lane. The handbook may include the specific lane training activities listed in table G-1 on page G-2 plus the following:  A memorandum of agreement between units involved in conducting and training in the lane area.  A lane planning timeline.  Guidance on related subordinate leader and collective training that the unit leader may wish to consider for training before conduct of the lane.  Tips that will aid the unit leader in preparing and executing the lane. Appendix G G-8 FM 7-0 14 June 2021 EVALUATOR HANDBOOK G-14. Evaluators (and possibly opposing force [OPFOR] personnel) use evaluator handbooks. These may include—  Special instructions to evaluators and OPFOR such as timing of actions or AARs.  A list of OPFOR collective countertasks (with training and evaluation outlines) and supporting individual tasks.  A lane diagram (one for each lane in the lane area).  A lane communications network diagram.  A lane schedule.  Evaluator duties, responsibilities, and procedures.  AAR procedures.  General safety and environmental guidance.  First aid procedures.  Exercise rules of engagement. 14 June 2021 FM 7-0 H-1 Appendix H External Evaluation OVERVIEW H-1. An external evaluation (EXEVAL) is a unit exercise to measure the proficiency rating of selected collective tasks in accordance with Army standards as outlined in proponent-developed training and evaluation outlines. The EXEVAL exercises command and control, communications, movement, and operations against an actual or simulated opposing force (OPFOR) in a replicated operational environment. EXEVALs are also used to validate training proficiency for an operational deployment or a specific mission. (See the Army Training Network (ATN) at https://atn.army.mil for more on EXEVALs.) KEY PERSONNEL H-2. EXEVALs are conducted by leaders outside the evaluated unit. Paragraphs H-3 through H-14 discuss these leaders. The key personnel who conduct EXEVALs include—  Senior commander.  Chief evaluator.  Senior noncommissioned officer (NCO) evaluators.  Next higher commander.  Evaluated unit commander.  Exercise control (EXCON).  Opposing force (OPFOR) team leader.  White cell. SENIOR COMMANDER H-3. The senior EXEVAL commander directing the EXEVAL must be two echelons up and within the evaluated unit’s chain of command.For example, the brigade commander directs EXEVALs of subordinate companies. These responsibilities include—  Directing execution, coordination and resourcing the EXEVAL.  Designating a chief evaluator to conduct the EXEVAL.  Training and certifying evaluators and OPFOR personnel.  Resourcing and participating in the EXEVAL final after action review (AAR). H-4. The senior commander initiates, organizes, and provides the resources to conduct the EXEVAL to include designating the chief evaluator. The senior commander oversees planning, preparation, and execution, assisting as necessary. This commander is also responsible for the training and certification of evaluators and OPFOR personnel. CHIEF EVALUATOR H-5. The chief evaluator must be at least the same rank as the commander or leader of the evaluated unit. This person does not have to be a commander or former commander, but when practicable, this is preferred. For example, the brigade logistics staff officer (captain) could be the chief evaluator for an EXEVAL of company B (captain commanding). In another example, the platoon leader of 3d platoon (first lieutenant) could be the chief evaluator of 2d platoon (second lieutenant, platoon leader). H-6. The duties and responsibilities of the chief evaluator include— Appendix H H-2 FM 7-0 14 June 2021  Dialoging with and coordinating activities with the senior commander.  Conducting the EXEVAL.  Planning, coordinating, and facilitating the final AAR.  Publishing the EXEVAL after action report for the evaluated unit commander (copy furnished to the next higher and senior commander). SENIOR NONCOMMISSIONED OFFICER EVALUATORS H-7. Senior NCO evaluators provide significant depth to evaluator teams. Senior NCOs bring a deep knowledge of training individual Soldiers, crews, and small teams to evaluation teams. These NCOs provide important performance insights and observations to the quality and scope of the evaluation. NEXT HIGHER COMMANDER H-8. The evaluated unit’s next higher commander in dialogue with the senior commander establishes training objectives for the EXEVAL. This commander’s responsibilities are—  Prior to the EXEVAL, dialoging with the senior commander, chief evaluator, and evaluated unit commander or leader regarding training objectives and other EXEVAL training expectations.  Physically attending the exercise.  Coaching and mentoring the evaluated unit commander.  Attending the final EXEVAL AAR.  Following the EXEVAL dialogues with the evaluated unit commander regarding EXEVAL results and future training plans. H-9. While the next higher commander does not plan for or conduct the EXEVAL, the exercise itself provides an important venue to observe the performance of the evaluated unit. The dialogue following the exercise allows both commanders the opportunity to discuss plans to sustain training strengths while improving performance weaknesses. Where the next higher unit is a battalion or above, that echelon staff assists the chief evaluator in planning and preparing the EXEVAL, to include developing a master scenario event list (known as MSEL) and associated orders and directives. EVALUATED UNIT COMMANDER OR LEADER H-10. The evaluated unit commander or leader focuses pre-EXEVAL training on the agreed upon training objectives. At the conclusion of the EXEVAL, the evaluated unit commander or leader dialogues again with the next higher commander to discuss the outcome of the EXEVAL. For company and higher EXEVALs, periodic training briefings (quarterly or annual) should discuss results of past EXEVALs and planning for future EXEVALs. For platoon and below EXEVALs, company and platoon training meetings include discussions of exercise plans and results. EXERCISE CONTROL H-11. The EXEVAL EXCON has overall responsibility for the conduct of the exercise. It ensures the tactical play follows the evaluation plan and master scenario event list to ensure training objectives are exercised and evaluated. The EXCON provides daily EXEVAL updates to both the senior commander and the evaluated unit commander or leader on the status of the EXEVAL. The EXCON officer in charge reports to the chief evaluator. OPPOSING FORCE TEAM LEADER H-12. The OPFOR team leader is responsible for the training and proficiency of OPFOR personnel and the tactical planning and execution of OPFOR maneuvers and engagements. This team leader ensures OPFOR units realistically replicate threat forces in accordance with TC 7-100 and with the exercise order of battle executing threat operation plans in support of EXEVAL training objectives. The OPFOR team leader reports to the chief evaluator. External Evaluation 14 June 2021 FM 7-0 H-3 WHITE CELL H-13. The white cell is designed to alleviate administrative needs outside the training environment so the evaluated unit, OPFOR, and other player units can focus on training. Some of the specific requirements the white cell performs include transportation support, drivers, support personnel, Red Cross services, and keeping track of unit locations and needs. The white cell officer in charge reports to the chief evaluator. EXERCISE EVALUATION AFTER ACTION REPORT H-14. The chief evaluator writes the EXEVAL after action report and provides it to the evaluated unit commander and next higher commander. This report provides notification of the results of the EXEVAL as well as an historical record for future planning. It is in the form of a memorandum and includes at a minimum—  Identification of the evaluated unit.  Inclusive dates of the EXEVAL.  Purpose of the EXEVAL to include selected training objectives.  Concept of the tactical scenario.  Significant observations during the EXEVAL to include training and evaluation outlines.  Conclusion (specifics regarding whether the training objectives were either met, or not met). The EXEVAL after action report is provided to the evaluated unit commander and next higher commander within 10 working days of the EXEVAL end of exercise. A copy is also furnished to the senior commander. EXERCISE EVALUATION ORGANIZATION H-15. EXEVALs above company level require a robust evaluator organization due to the echelon, scope, and complexity of the exercise. For company and below EXEVALs, these are less complex, but evaluator functions are similar and equally important. Figure H-1 shows a recommended, base EXEVAL organizational architecture that can be tailored and expanded to the scope and echelon of the exercise. Note. Figure H-1 does not depict any support personnel or equipment requirements necessary to conduct the EXEVAL. Figure H-1. Example EXEVAL evaluator organization This page intentionally left blank. 14 June 2021 FM 7-0 I-1 Appendix I Live-Fire Training OVERVIEW I-1. Live-fire training is the most effective way to generate confidence and trust among leaders, teammates, and Soldiers. Live-fire training involves movement and maneuver as well as employing weapon systems in a training environment using full-caliber ammunition. It includes prerequisite training, weapons qualification, and collective live fire. This training provides realistic, hands-on weapons training to achieve and sustain individual and collective unit weapons proficiency. Live-fire training should be a training event that stresses leaders and Soldiers at every echelon. I-2. With proper planning and resourcing, live-fire training is a tailorable and scalable training exercise based on the training objectives set by the senior certifying commander. It may incorporate numerous tactical tasks against a dynamic opposing force in a live environment with realistic battlefield effects, if available from a unit’s installation. Properly executed live-fire training is not a traditional range, but a replicated force- on-force scenario under live-fire conditions. (See the Army Training Network (ATN) at https://atn.army.mil for more on live-fire training.) I-3. Live-fire training provides training for—  Weapon systems proficiency.  Maneuver training.  Fire control and distribution.  Live-fire certification.  Command and control skills in a live-fire environment.  Individual and unit movement and maneuver techniques under live-fire conditions.  Weapons systems safety awareness and compliance.  Risk management (risk to force, risk to mission).  Leader development opportunities.  Soldier confidence in assigned weapons systems and leader confidence in individual and collective training proficiency. I-4. Live-fire training takes a building block approach from developing, for example, individual weapons proficiency to crew and team proficiency to squad proficiency to platoon proficiency. To reach weapons proficiency, individuals and units must first learn and demonstrate basic weapon skills. Once they achieve this foundation, units begin to build on it layer by layer, echelon by echelon until proficiency is achieved. Units should maintain subordinate leaders in their positions or determine a way to re-certify new leaders if time is not available to execute another live-fire exercise at the lower level. Additionally, when units plan live-fire training, commanders strive to stabilize leaders in their positions as much as practicable. They also plan periodic re-certification programs for these leaders as well as establish a solid live-fire certification program for new leaders. I-5. Live-fire training progresses in four stages:  Prerequisite training.  Weapons qualification (individual, crew-served, and platform).  Maneuver training.  Live-fire (crawl, walk, run). Note. The first three stages can happen any time prior to execution of live-fire training. Appendix I I-2 FM 7-0 14 June 2021 PREREQUISITE TRAINING I-6. Prior to conducting any live-fire, prerequisite and familiarization training is conducted to inform and educate Soldiers and leaders on weapon system functions, capabilities, and safety requirements. When available, training aids, devices, simulators, and simulations (known as TADSS) provide additional hands- on training that replicate weapon system performance and characteristics prior to conducting live fire. I-7. Prerequisite training for each echelon of a live fire ensures proficiency on all tasks that will be executed under live-fire conditions. Based on collective live-fire experiences at combat training centers, commanders consider the following recommended prerequisite training when developing a live-fire exercise (LFX) program:  Conduct a LFX within the required time (typically 12 months) at one echelon below the live fire to be executed. For example, when executing a platoon live fire, each of the platoon’s subordinate squads should have completed squad live fire. Certify new leaders if unable to maintain subordinate leaders in position and there is insufficient time to re-execute live-fire exercises at the lower level.  Conduct situational training exercises at the level of the LFX. Ensure that most key leaders occupy the positions they will fill during the execution of the LFX.  Individual training, to include integration of multiple warfighting functions, must be executed prior to the live fire. Ideally, this is done under live-fire conditions; however, the commander may underwrite the risk of using virtual or constructive training environments.  Units should execute certification events when employing specialty weapons such as the Javelin, TOW (for tube launched, optically tracked, wire guided), hand grenades, and explosive breaching techniques prior to execution of the LFX.  Above company level, a separate fire coordination exercise should be executed for attack aviation, mortars, and artillery to ensure subordinate commanders or leaders have the requisite proficiencies to integrate these assets with ground maneuver forces. I-8. Collective training under live-fire conditions should seek to incorporate the entire combined arms formation such as during a combat training center brigade combat team LFX. The following vignette illustrates live-fire training that incorporates multiple live-fire tasks. Live-Fire Training 14 June 2021 FM 7-0 I-3 Notional Live-Fire During preparation for a combat training center (CTC) brigade combat team (BCT)- level live-fire exercise, the BCT communicated interest in conducting a live-fire exercise on its BCT’s prioritized mission-essential task, Conduct an Attack, while incorporating as much of its BCT into the training as possible. The BCT’s division leadership assisted by establishing multiple live-fire tasks throughout the BCT’s battlefield framework. During execution of the BCT live-fire exercise, the cavalry squadron conducted a zone reconnaissance with a combined arms battalion establishing a support by fire. The combined arms battalion suppressed an enemy mechanized infantry battalion to facilitate a combined arms breach for a follow-on battalion. During the deliberate breach, the BCT integrated a military police platoon with the breach force at the point of the breach. The BCT and military police platoon leveraged signals intelligence elements to enable suppression of enemy air defense. While the BCT engaged a dug-in mechanized infantry battalion, the brigade support battalion secured routes and conducted sustainment patrols that incorporated convoy live-fire exercises. The sustainment patrols also provided tactical resupply, evacuated casualties under live-fire conditions, defended the brigade support area against level II threats, and integrated attack aviation and mortars. Upon conclusion of the training, the BCT commander noted the BCT had maximized its live-fire opportunities at the CTC. It trained on the BCT’s highest priority mission- essential task under live-fire conditions, focused on fire control and distribution, and simultaneously integrated its sustainment and protection warfighting function elements. The BCT also trained on the de-confliction of airspace and increased the realism of technical, tactical, and sustainment triggers. This integration resulted in the removal the ‘range-ism’ in the live-fire training and facilitated the full immersion of the BCT into the training. WEAPONS QUALIFICATION I-9. Weapons qualification consists of individuals and units qualifying on assigned weapons to demonstrate proficiency in their assigned weapons. Proponent standards for qualification are found in weapon system publications, typically training circulars. AR 350-1 lists the frequency for weapons qualification. See TC 3-20.0 to properly plan and account for required tables prior to live-fire training. Table I-1 on page I-4 illustrates an integrated weapon training strategy (known as IWTS). Appendix I I-4 FM 7-0 14 June 2021 Table I-1.

Weapons qualification includes individual and crew-served or crew-based weapons systems (for example, M1 Abrams crew and M2 Bradley crew). Crew-based weapons should require Soldiers to complete, as a crew, the appropriate gunnery tables prior to the execution of the live fire. Maneuver live fire should not be used in lieu of executing required gunnery tables in accordance with applicable gunnery manuals. I-11.Requisite gunnery tables should be completed for attack aviation, indirect fire systems, and aviation door gunners prior to execution of live-fire training to ensure a safe and realistic training scenario. MANEUVER TRAINING I-12. Prior to execution of live-fire training, units must master maneuver training at the echelons to be trained in a LFX. Units that master movement and maneuver, and master transitioning from one to the other prior to execution of live-fire training, can maximize learning and mastery of the effects of a LFX. During live-fire execution, units should execute proper movement and maneuver formations. Failing to maneuver properly should result in penalties that require the unit to retrain on noted deficiencies prior to continuing through the exercise. Poor maneuver affects every aspect of a live-fire operation and adds a critical safety issue with surface danger zones when not properly conducted. LIVE FIRE I-13. Live-fire training takes place at the conclusion of all prerequisite training and weapons qualification. It is the demonstration of an individual or units ability to employ weapon systems under live-fire conditions. In the case of collective live-fire training, the unit commander two echelons above determines the collective live-fire tasks trained—as specified in the unit’s long-range training plan. The standards for these tasks are found in the collective task’s training and evaluation outline (known as T&EO). The standards specify if organizations can perform the task under live-fire conditions. Live-Fire Training 14 June 2021 FM 7-0 I-5 I-14. Execution of LFXs should follow a crawl-walk-run model to ensure that the organization is proficient and prepared to execute the live fire safely and effectively. For example, in the crawl-walk-run method a leader walks through the objective (crawl), a unit completes a rehearsal of a dry or blank fire iteration (walk), and then the unit executes a culminating live-fire iteration (run). Commanders need to assess the proficiency of their units continually and adjust training accordingly. (See DA Pam 385-63 and individual installation range procedures for additional live-fire requirements.) I-15. The execution of LFXs rotates units by echelon through all phases of training so all Soldiers participate and understand requirements to accomplish the mission. The execution of one LFX encompasses the following events at a minimum:  Safety brief. The officer or noncommissioned officer in charge conducts a safety briefing. The safety briefing can share input from personnel on new techniques, hazards, and possible emergency instructions and procedures.  Risk management. See paragraph 3-4 for risk management.  Leader participation. The commander provides input and receives reports from subordinate leaders during the LFX. The commander can direct action as a teaching point or allow the unit to maintain momentum as the LFX progresses.  Logistics support and participation. Medics, fire support teams, engineer personnel, and others participate in the LFX performing the same duties they would in combat. This provides training and identifies unit expectations when conducting operations. These personnel should follow a similar training progression for prerequisite training and weapons qualification to ensure all personnel executing the live fire meet requirements.  Observers-controllers. Observers-controllers assist the unit in contributing to the realism of force- on-force exercises and LFXs. These personnel coordinate indirect fires, evaluate casualties, control targets, stop unsafe acts, and assist in the conduct of after action reviews.  Evaluation. See discussion for evaluation beginning in paragraph 5-3.  After action review. See appendix K for more information on after action reviews.  Assessment. See discussion for assessment beginning in paragraph 5-7. MULTIECHELON TRAINING DURING LIVE-FIRE EXERCISES I-16. LFXs provide an excellent opportunity for organizations to conduct multiechelon training. These exercises require significant logistics support personnel and equipment to include all classes of supply. Incorporating multiechelon training during live fires allows organizations across the Army to maximize the use of limited training time and resources. I-17. Development of a higher headquarters operation order can drive the planning process at multiple echelons above the unit conducting the LFX. For example, a platoon LFX could easily include a brigade combat team- or brigade-level operation order that would result in the battalion exercising the military decision-making process, and the company exercising troop leading procedures. I-18. A robust scenario utilizing live, virtual, and constructive training environments provides an excellent opportunity to synchronize the warfighting functions at echelon to successfully execute the LFX as realistically as possible. PLANNING CONSIDERATIONS I-19. Effective live-fire training requires a complete understanding of applicable guidance including regulations, doctrine, local directives, risk management, and weapon training circulars. It is a leaders’ responsibility to be familiar with these publications. Paragraphs I-20 through I-37 are important planning terms, procedures, and considerations for live-fire training. I-20. A surface danger zone (SDZ) is the ground and airspace designated within the training complex (to include associated safety areas) for vertical and lateral containment of projectiles, fragments, debris, and components resulting from the firing, launching, or detonation. (See AR 385-63 for more information on SDZs.) Leaders need to thoroughly understand this regulation, local regulations, and ballistic effects if necessary. Units should contact installation range operations when desiring to deviate from SDZs outlined in Appendix I I-6 FM 7-0 14 June 2021 AR 385-63. Installation commanding generals and range operations may have existing SDZ deviations or the process to request them available to units, enabling units to execute LFXs with more realism for training units. Unit master gunners should be heavily involved in this process to aid commanders with the needed expertise to exercise live fire with the most realistic scenarios, while ensuring safety throughout. (See AR 385-63 for details of deviation procedures.) I-21. Fire control consists of fire control measures and fire commands. Fire control allows a unit to select targets, initiate fires at desired instant, adjust fire, control rate of fire, and halt fire. Fire control measures control the distribution of fires. Fire control measures should exist at all times (such as during movement, halts, and actions on the objective). Fire commands execute the control measures desired. They can take the form of oral commands, arm-and-hand signals, visual and sound signals, personal contact, or unit standard operating procedure. I-22. Graphic control measures must be trained at all echelons of live-fire planning and execution. These control measures allow for the control of the maneuvering force and adjacent units, and allow higher level headquarters to track mission progress and de-confliction. The proper use of graphic control measures in a live-fire environment allows for maximum realism and massing weapon effects on enemy positions. Units that employ graphic control measures correctly will allow for more complex and intensive live-fire scenarios. I-23. Fire support coordination measures are used in live-fire. Leaders in a LFX must thoroughly understand developing and employing fire support coordination measures in all phases of live-fire. These control measures allow for the expeditious engagement of targets and provide a safeguard for planning the maneuver of friendly forces. Coordinating, maintaining, and disseminating a complete list of fire support coordination measures will facilitate avoidance of friendly fire incidents and de-conflict operations. These measures will allow a synchronized and robust operation to occur with increased fluidity. I-24. De-conflict airspace to ensure airspace is clear of the effects of direct and indirect weapons systems prior to employing air assets to include unmanned aircraft systems, rotary-wing aircraft, and fixed-wing aircraft. It is imperative that both trainers and participants understand aviation flight paths and altitudes tasked to support LFXs. Accounting for the airspace and incorporating these elements into the planning process will ensure that leaders, at echelon, understand how to account for the effects of direct and indirect fire weapon systems on flight paths and allow for the simultaneous employment of all weapon systems in a LFX. I-25. Rehearsals are critical to prevent personnel from becoming disoriented and to check control procedures and marking techniques. Rehearsals must be conducted first during daylight to orient personnel and then at night to test control procedures and equipment. Rehearsals also give leaders an opportunity to identify gaps and refine the plan, as required. I-26. Adjacent unit coordination is practiced by units during rehearsals for elements organic to the live- fire and those outside the unit within the scenario. Successful planning of adjacent unit coordination enables units to understand conditions required to be met before subsequent actions. This coordination ensures integrated and maximum levels of fire to both defeat the enemy and train leaders to ensure their plan and fires do not inhibit adjacent unit maneuver toward their respective enemy objectives. I-27. Positioning of forces in live-fire is a procedure leaders consider. Unit leaders must plan for primary, alternate, subsequent, and tertiary positions prior to execution. This planning allows for maximizing employment of weapon systems and allows units to maximize weapons effects. I-28. Engagement area development is essential for units to plan and understand how to employ all direct, indirect, and aviation elements incorporated into the live-fire. This process will allow leaders to understand how to employ all available assets to realistically defeat a complex and maneuvering enemy force replicated through target presentation. I-29. Target reference points are devices used by the unit for fire control and distribution. They should be implemented using materials that enable both visible and limited visibility detection. Examples units use for target reference points can include reverse polarity tape, infrared strobes, and other materials visible for aircraft. I-30. Night vision devices are necessary for personnel to work effectively if infrared lights or thermal markers are used. Soldiers who intend to conduct live fire at night using night vision devices will conduct Live-Fire Training 14 June 2021 FM 7-0 I-7 proper train up and qualification with those specific pieces of equipment to mitigate risk and ensure success in gaining expertise. I-31. Communications requirements are the same for a night live-fire range as they are for a day live-fire range. The difference is that units use plain red star clusters as an emergency cease fire signal during the night instead of red smoke which is not visible at night (see local range requirements). I-32. Special considerations for night exercises exist for leaders of LFXs. At night, LFXs are inherently more complex due to the increased difficulty of control, target identification, location identification, and execution. Controlling movement and checking positions of personnel and vehicles becomes more difficult. Every precaution must be taken to ensure the safety of personnel. A plan for night firing contains all the details of day firing with additional considerations to ensure successful training and safety. I-33. Light and weather data are considerations for leaders. When planning a night LFX, light data must be considered. For example, high illumination greatly enhances command and control. On the other hand, low illumination makes navigation and orientation more difficult especially when combining dismounted and mounted elements. A heavy overcast will negate the effects of the moon and stars. As the time for the night fire draws near, staff should closely monitor the weather. I-34. Illumination should be planned by the firing unit as it would be in combat. Even if the firing unit does not intend to use fire support, it should still plan for illumination for practice. I-35. Training realism is a procedure leaders consider. Every effort should be made to increase the realism of live fire to mirror the realism of combat. All Soldiers should participate in LFXs with the weapon system and protective gear they would use in combat. This will allow Soldiers to acclimatize and prepare for combat when needed. Vehicles in live fire should operate closed-hatch. Chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear (known as CBRN) protective garments should be worn, as available, to prepare dismounted Soldiers and vehicle crews to operate in the most extreme of environments in training that they may encounter in combat. I-36. Multiechelon training is a consideration for leaders. All live-fire training should include as many subordinate and higher-level echelons as can be incorporated. The complexity and synchronization constructed will lead to a more robust and realistic live fire for both the training audience and the trainers. I-37. Integration of assets at echelon by warfighting function is a procedure leaders consider. When planning a LFX, commanders and staff account for additional assets that could be available by warfighting function and at echelon. This is especially true when units utilize LFXs as part of multiechelon training. LIVE FIRE AS LEADER DEVELOPMENT I-38. LFXs provide an excellent opportunity to plan and execute leader development during each stage of the training management cycle. The following vignette on page I-8 illustrates not only the complexity involved in planning a successful combined arms live-fire exercise (known as CALFEX), but also the opportunities available for leader development planning and execution. Appendix I I-8 FM 7-0 14 June 2021 Notional Combined Arms Live-Fire Exercise In preparation for an upcoming combat training center rotation to the National Training Center (known as NTC), COL Kerry Smith conducted multiple company-level combined arms live-fire exercises (CALFEXs) with his brigade combat team (BCT). COL Smith wanted to certify every troop, company, and battery in a combined arms live-fire conducting a deliberate attack and transitioning to a hasty defense under live- fire conditions. The deliberate decision of the commander to certify his company-level leaders provided an invaluable opportunity for the commander to train and certify his maneuver units, validate risk management processes, build shared understanding of the BCT’s standards, and share best practices commensurate with learning organizations. This opportunity enabled the commander to coach and mentor the battalion or task force commanders and staff to manage training. Lastly, it enabled the commander to check on the task force subordinate training objectives to ensure they nested with the BCT commander’s intent. During the rotation of units through the CALFEX, the BCT commander would observe the planning process for the commanders, such as the operation order with graphics and their rehearsals, including a walk-through rehearsal with a mounted rehearsal. (See figure I-1 and figure I-2.) Following the preparation phase, the BCT commander would follow in his combat platform with his battalion commander and provide the necessary command and control to drive execution of the company-level training. Upon completion of the training event, the commander would conduct the after action review with the company leadership. They would develop a plan of action to conduct retraining and disseminate best practices across the brigade to ensure the unit improves each day. The logical training objectives are the execution of the directed task: deliberate attack and hasty defense. Indirectly, this task provided the BCT commander an opportunity to coach and teach both the task force and company commanders positioning on the battlefield, exercising command and control, conducting time management, adhering to the BCT common operational picture, and staying accountable to the brigade standing operating procedures. These coaching points reinforce and connect the preparatory work to training management that enable a large organization to graduate from crew- to collective-level training. Senior leader investment in the development of leaders and units during home station training informs BCT-level readiness and enables agile formations capable of executing in a multi-domain decisive action environment. Live-Fire Training 14 June 2021 FM 7-0 I-9 I-39. Leaders should consider the following leader development opportunities for a combined arms live-fire exercise:  Planning and preparation:  Training guidance.  Commanders-to-commander dialogues (training briefings).  Leader development program.  Training event planning and resourcing.  Tactical planning (the military decision-making process and troop leading procedures).  Leader certification.  Risk management. Figure I-1. Live-fire rehearsal Figure I-2. Sample CALFEX graphic Appendix I I-10 FM 7-0 14 June 2021  Execution:  Command and control.  Coordination and distribution of fires.  Marksmanship.  Maneuver.  Sustainment.  Safety.  Managing fatigue.  Evaluate and assess:  Certified leader evaluation of training (training and evaluation outline).  Commander-assessed training.  After action reviews.  Captured and shared lessons learned.  Leader counseling.14 June 2021 FM 7-0 J-1 Appendix J Training Environments OVERVIEW J-1. A training environment is an environment comprised of conditions, supporting resources, and time that enables training tasks to proficiency. There are three basic training environments: live, virtual, and constructive (LVC). With unlimited time and resources, units execute realistic training in a live environment. The realities of limited training time and resources dictate that commanders use creative and innovative means and resources to train in other-than-live training environments, or in a combination of all three environments. See table J-1 for the environment descriptions. J-2. Commanders leverage training support enablers to obtain required training proficiencies. For example, when a company cannot get all the range time it needs to develop individual weapon proficiency, a commander gets creative. The commander makes use of individual weapon simulators to develop basic skills first before taking the unit to the live-fire range to qualify. This technique makes time at the range more productive and efficient by reducing range time and cost. (See the Army Training Network (ATN) at https://atn.army.mil for more other-than-live training environments.) Table J-1. Training environments Environment Participants Description Live Training battalion and below executed in field conditions using tactical equipment Virtual Training brigade and below computer-generated battlefields in simulators Constructive Training platoon through echelons above corps computer models and simulations Blended Training platoon through echelons above corps two or more training environments Integrated Training platoon through echelons above corps virtual and constructive environments, to include information systems LIVE, VIRTUAL, AND CONSTRUCTIVE TRAINING J-3. Live training is executed in field conditions using tactical equipment. It involves real people operating real systems. Live training may be enhanced by the use of training aids, devices, simulations, and simulators (known as TADSS). J-4. Virtual training involves real people operating simulated or actual systems. Units use virtual training to exercise motor control, decision-making, and communication skills. Sometimes called human-in-the-loop training, it involves real people operating various systems. Gaming is a subset of the virtual training environment. Gaming uses gaming technologies to create capabilities to help train individuals and small units. J-5. Constructive training uses computer models and simulations to exercise command and staff functions. It involves real people interacting with simulated units operating simulated systems. Constructive training can be conducted by units from platoon through echelons above corps. J-6. Units use virtual and constructive training environments to supplement, enhance, and complement live training. Virtual and constructive training environments help increase the entry level of proficiency for live training and reduce the time needed to prepare training. Based on training objectives and available resources—such as time, ammunition, simulations, and range availability—commanders determine the right mix and frequency of LVC training to ensure organizations use resources efficiently. Appendix J J-2 FM 7-0 14 June 2021 J-7. Commanders can employ each training environment independently or combine two or more environments to meet the training objective. Employing a training environment independently is the easiest to plan and prepare. If using more than one training environment, leaders may use either a blended training environment (known as BTE) or an integrated training environment (known as ITE). BLENDED TRAINING J-8. Blended training is unit training conducted concurrently within two or more training environments (live, virtual, or constructive simulation). When planned and resourced, blended training can include information systems that enable the unit commander and other leaders to receive a common operational picture or that enable the activity in one training environment to be used to stimulate reactions in the other environment. For example, if a company only has maneuver space for one live platoon, but wants to train the company headquarters and leadership, then it can train two platoons in a tactical simulation or virtual environment and train the third platoon in a live training environment. In this example, the company leaders have the tactical challenge of commanding all three platoons and providing a more realistic training event than if only the live platoon were training. J-9. The integrated training environment is enabled by an integrated architecture allowing full interaction between virtual and constructive environments, to include information systems. The integrated training environment also allows limited interaction between live forces and virtual or simulated environments (for example, virtual and simulated artillery can cause casualties in live forces, if enabled, and support ‘live’ fire markers). J-10. Figure J-1 depicts different training environments and their mixtures at different echelons in relation to the level of training. There are several LVC options available; commanders determine the mix. Figure J-1. Sample LVC training mix from brigade to individual Soldier 14 June 2021 FM 7-0 K-1 Appendix K After Action Reviews OVERVIEW K-1. An after action review (AAR) is a guided analysis of a Soldier’s or organization’s performance, conducted at appropriate times during and at the conclusion of a training event or operation with the objective of improving future performance. It includes a facilitator, event participants, and other observers. AARs are conducted at every echelon and are essential in correcting observed training deficiencies by providing feedback that is immediate, direct, and standards based. K-2. AARs are a professional discussion requiring the participation of those trained. AARs enable and encourage participants to self-discover what happened then develop a plan for improving task performance. AARs focus on the commander’s intent, guidance, training objectives, and task standards. They are not a critique, and leaders avoid creating an environment of pointing out failures. The climate of the AAR must encourage candid and open discussion of task performance without stifling learning and team building by—  Emphasizing meeting the Army standard on tasks rather than judging success or failure.  Using leading questions to encourage self-discovery and important lessons.  Allowing a large number of Soldiers and leaders—including opposing forces (OPFORs)—to participate so more lessons are shared.  Assigning leader responsibility to improve task performance. K-3. AARs also signal the start of the next planning cycle. Lessons learned from the review of performance provide leaders the specifics of what and how to perform better for future training. The AAR process ensures participants self-discover what went right, what went wrong, and how to perform to standard next time. Leaders capture AAR results to craft better, more effective training plans and execution. AARs also help leaders frame the unit’s retraining efforts. To the greatest extent, training is not complete until all training objectives are met. When this is not possible, leaders ensure retraining is planned and executed as expeditiously as possible. K-4. AARs can be either formal or informal. A formal AAR is resource-intensive and involves planning for and preparing the AAR site, supporting training aids, and supporting personnel. Informal AARs require far less planning and preparation, and they can and should be conducted when unit performance requires it. (See the Army Training Network (ATN) at https://atn.army.mil for more on AARs.) FUNDAMENTALS OF TRAINING AFTER ACTION REVIEW K-5. AARs have the following fundamental characteristics. They—  Are conducted during or immediately after each event.  Focus on commander’s intent, guidance, training objectives, and task standards.  Involve all participants in the discussion.  Use open-ended questions.  Encourage initiative and innovation.  Determine observed strengths and weaknesses.  Link performance to subsequent training. Appendix K K-2 FM 7-0 14 June 2021 AGENDA FOR TRAINING AFTER ACTION REVIEW K-6. AARs follow an agenda, which includes—  A review of what was supposed to happen.  Establishing what did happen.  Determining what was right or wrong with what happened.  Determining how to perform the task to standard next time. K-7. A training AAR begins with a review of what was supposed to happen. A facilitator or evaluator, along with participants, reviews what was supposed to happen. This review is based on the commander’s guidance, training objectives, and tasks to train. K-8. The training AAR continues as the evaluator establishes what happened. The facilitator and participants jointly determine what actually occurred during the training event, phase, or operation. The leader attempts to gather as many views or perspectives—such as from the OPFOR, squad leader, team leader, or rifleman—as feasible. These views help to establish a common understanding of the operation or event. Leaders then understand the complexity of an event and work to solve complex, ill-defined problems quickly. An effective AAR requires an accurate account of events. The evaluator and participants determine what actually happened during the performance of the task. K-9. After establishing the events that occurred, the AAR covers what was right or wrong with what happened. Participants identify the strong and weak points of their performances based on the commander’s guidance and performance measures. The facilitator guides discussions to ensure maximum input that is operationally sound and relevant to the training event. Effectively guided discussions reach conclusions that are doctrinally sound, consistent with Army standards, and relevant to the unit mission. K-10. The AAR concludes as participants determine how the unit should complete the task differently next time. The facilitator guides the unit in self-determining how it might perform the task more effectively in the future. The unit identifies problems and provides solutions as well as identifies who is responsible for making the recommended changes. Additionally, the facilitator guides the discussion to determine a more effective way to train the tasks to achieve the commander’s guidance. PLANNING CONSIDERATIONS K-11. Commanders identify opportunities to conduct AARs, assign evaluator responsibilities, and specify the time and resources to conduct AARs. As leaders conduct training, subordinate leaders assess unit and leader proficiency on collective and individual tasks, conduct on-the-spot coaching, and lead informal AARs. These tasks require that leaders understand the commander’s intent, guidance, concept of operations, and training objectives. K-12. The amount and level of detail needed during the planning and preparation processes depend on the type of AAR to be conducted and available resources. The AAR process has four steps:  Plan.  Execute.  Evaluate.  Integrate and share lessons learned. STEP 1: PLAN K-13. Commanders provide their guidance to develop an AAR plan for each training event. Subordinates determine how to achieve the commander’s guidance. The guidance applies to formal and informal AARs and identifies—  Who conducts the AAR.  Who provides information.  Aspects of the operation an AAR evaluates.  Who attends the AAR. After Action Reviews 14 June 2021 FM 7-0 K-3  When and where the AAR occurs.  A senior trainer to capture the results of the AAR and to integrate results into training in accordance with the 8-Step Training Model. K-14. Leaders or evaluators use the AAR plan to identify critical locations and events to observe so they can provide the unit a timely and valid assessment. Critical places can include unit maintenance collection points, passage points, and unit aid stations. The AAR plan identifies responsible persons (internal or external to the unit) who facilitate the AAR for a particular event. The leader or evaluator is the individual tasked to observe training, provide control for the training, and lead the AAR. Selecting and Training Evaluators K-15. Commanders select leaders and evaluators who—  Have demonstrated task proficiency.  Know the duties they are observing.  Know current doctrine. K-16. External evaluators are at least equal in rank to the leader of the unit they assess. Evaluators are not responsible for training the unit. That responsibility lies exclusively with the unit chain of command. If commanders choose between experience and an understanding of current doctrine or rank, they should go with experience. A staff sergeant with experience as a tank platoon sergeant is a better platoon evaluator than a sergeant first class who has no platoon sergeant experience. Commanders are responsible for training and certifying evaluators to include providing training on conducting AARs. Reviewing Training and Evaluation Outlines K-17. When planning the AAR, unit leaders review applicable training and evaluation outlines to understand task requirements and standards. Scheduling Stopping Points K-18. Leaders schedule the time and place to conduct AARs as an integral part of training events. They plan for AARs during and at the end of each critical phase or major training event. For example, a leader may plan a stopping point after issuing an operation order, upon the unit’s arrival at a new position, or after consolidation on an objective. Determining Attendance K-19. The AAR plan specifies who attends each AAR. At each echelon, an AAR has a primary set of participants. At squad and platoon levels, everyone attends and participates. At company or higher levels, it may not be practical to have everyone attend because of continuing operations or training. At company or higher levels, unit and OPFOR commanders, unit leaders, and other key players may be the only participants. Leaders or evaluators recommend additional participants attend based on specific observations. Choosing Training Aids K-20. Effective training aids directly support the discussion of the training and promote learning. The local training support center catalogs available training aids. Home station training support center support and training aids are available within the Army Training Support Enterprise. Under the right conditions, dry-erase boards, video equipment, digital maps, terrain models, and enlarged maps support AAR discussions. For example, if reconnaissance reveals no sites provide a view of the exercise area, the AAR facilitator can use a terrain table or digital map. When choosing training aids in the AAR plan, leaders consider terrain visibility, group size, suitability to task, and availability of electrical power. Leaders need only use a training aid if it makes the AAR better. Appendix K K-4 FM 7-0 14 June 2021 Reviewing the After Action Review Plan K-21. The AAR plan is only a guide. Leaders and evaluators regularly review the AAR plan during training meetings to ensure the training meeting stays on topic and the plan meets the unit’s training needs. Commanders, leaders, and evaluators can adjust the plan as necessary, but changes take preparation and planning time away from subordinate leaders or evaluators. Using After Action Review Facilitators K-22. AAR facilitators are either internal or external evaluators. Internal facilitators participate in the training and are part of the organization whereas external facilitators do not. Facilitators have the responsibility to make and consolidate insights, observations, and lessons to facilitate the discussion of what happened. They accurately record what they see and hear to prevent loss of valuable information and feedback. These records include events, actions, and observations by time sequence. Facilitators use any recording system—such as notebooks, mobile devices, prepared forms, index cards, or video cameras—as long as it is reliable and sufficiently detailed (identifying times, places, and names). A recording system notates the date-time group of each observation so evaluators can easily integrate their observations with observations of other evaluators. This collection of observations provides a comprehensive and detailed overview of what happened. K-23. Facilitators determine when and where to observe training. The best location is where the performance of important tasks will occur. They do not always need to stay close to the unit leader. They should position themselves to avoid distracting training participants. Facilitators also avoid compromising the unit’s location or guidance by being obvious. They are professional, courteous, and as unobtrusive as possible at all times. They look and act like a member of the unit. For example, facilitators use individual and vehicle camouflage, movement techniques, and cover and concealment. Selecting After Action Review Sites K-24. AARs occur at or near the training site. During formal AARs, leaders identify and inspect designated AAR sites and prepare a site diagram showing the placement of training aids and other equipment. Designated AAR sites allow pre-positioning of training aids and rapid assembly of key personnel, minimizing wasted time. K-25. An effective AAR site allows Soldiers to see the terrain where training took place. If this is not possible, the trainer finds a location that allows them to see the terrain where the most critical or significant actions occurred.Time and resources determine the type and complexity of the terrain model, enlarged map, sketch, or copy of the unit’s graphics. Collecting Observations K-26. Leaders and senior evaluators need a complete picture of what happened during the training to conduct an effective AAR. During an informal AAR, the leader or facilitator can rely upon the input from the unit during the AAR or gather observations from subordinates and OPFOR (if applicable). The observations gathered assist the leader with gaining an understanding of the operation from subordinate leaders that help drive the AAR. K-27. During a formal AAR, the senior evaluator receives input from subordinates, supporting units, and adjacent units. This combined input provides the senior evaluator with a comprehensive review of the observed unit and its impact on the higher unit’s mission. The senior evaluator also receives input from OPFOR leaders, players, and evaluators. Organizing the After Action Review K-28. The facilitator gathers all the information from evaluators and observers and organizes notes in a chronological sequence to understand the flow of events. The facilitator selects and sequences key events of the operation in their relevance to the commander’s guidance, training objectives, tasks to train, and key discussion or teaching points. After Action Reviews 14 June 2021 FM 7-0 K-5 K-29. The facilitator then organizes the AAR using one of three techniques: chronological order of events, warfighting functions, or key events, themes, or issues. The chronological order of events technique is logical, structured, and easy to understand. It follows the flow of training from start to finish. By covering actions in the order they took place, Soldiers and leaders can better recall what happened. The warfighting functions technique structures the AAR using the warfighting functions. The AAR focuses on the warfighting functions and their associated systems (people, organizations, information, and processes) and links to the commander’s guidance and training objectives. Participants can identify strengths and weaknesses across all phases and can recommend solutions. This technique is useful in training staff sections. The last technique focuses on key events, themes, or issues. This technique focuses on critical training events, which directly support training objectives. This technique is effective when time is limited. Rehearsing K-30. Facilitators rehearse delivery of the AAR. They also rehearse with any supporting evaluators and observers as necessary. This rehearsal includes considering the possible questions or issues that participants may broach. Effective rehearsals include all the training resources that the actual AAR will use. STEP 2: EXECUTE K-31. The AAR begins when training activities stop, AAR preparation is complete, and key players assemble at the designated AAR site. The facilitator reviews the purpose and sequence of the AAR to ensure everyone understands why the AAR is conducted. The purpose of the AAR is for participants to discover strengths and weaknesses, propose solutions, and adopt actions to improve performance. Provide an Introduction and Rules K-32. First, the facilitator introduces everyone and requests the following:  Everyone participates if they have an insight, observation, or question that will help the unit identify and correct deficiencies or sustain strengths. The AAR is a dynamic, candid, and professional discussion of training that focuses on unit performance measured against the task standards (as expressed in the training and evaluation outline).  Participants avoid using the AAR as a critique. No one—regardless of rank, position, or strength of personality—has all the information or answers. AARs maximize training benefits by allowing Soldiers to learn from each other.  The AAR focuses on identifying weaknesses to improve and strengths to sustain. K-33. Soldier participation directly correlates to the atmosphere created during the introduction and command climate. The AAR leader makes a concerted effort to draw in Soldiers who seem reluctant to participate. The following guidance can help the facilitator create an atmosphere conducive to maximum participation:  Permit respectful disagreement.  Focus on learning and encourage people to give honest opinions.  Use open-ended and leading questions to guide the discussion of performance.  Enter the discussion only when necessary. State the Agenda K-34. The leader or evaluator states the AAR agenda. The leader or evaluator reviews the commander’s training objectives and restates the tasks reviewed, including conditions and standards for the tasks. Using tools—such as maps, operational graphics, terrain boards, sticks, and rocks—the commander or leader restates the mission, guidance, and concept of operations. The leader or evaluator may guide the discussion to ensure everyone understands the plan and the commander’s guidance. Another technique is to have subordinate leaders restate the mission and discuss the commander’s guidance and concept of operations. K-35. In a formal AAR, the OPFOR commander explains the OPFOR plan and actions. The OPFOR commander uses the same training aids as the friendly force commander, so that all participants understand the correlation between the plans. Appendix K K-6 FM 7-0 14 June 2021 Summarize What Happened K-36. The facilitator guides the review using a logical sequence of events to describe and discuss what happened. The facilitator and participants determine to the extent possible what actually happened during the training event, phase, or operation. The leader gathers as many views or perspectives (such as from the OPFOR, squad leader, team leader, and rifleman) as possible. These varied perspectives help the facilitator to establish a common understanding. Leaders then understand the complexity of an event and work to solve complex, ill-defined problems. K-37. The facilitator does not ask yes or no questions but encourages participation and guides discussion by using open-ended, leading questions. An open-ended question allows the person answering to reply based on what was significant to the Soldier. Open-ended questions are also much less likely to put Soldiers on the defensive; these questions are more effective in finding out what happened. As the discussion expands and more Soldiers add their perspectives, a clearer picture of what really happened emerges. The facilitator does not tell the Soldiers or leaders what was good or bad. The facilitator ensures that participants reveal specific issues, both positive and negative. Identify What Needs Improvement or Sustainment K-38. The unit discusses both its successes and failures in the context of the training mission, objectives, and performance measures. Participants consider whether the resulting decisions and actions were ethical, effective, and efficient. To sustain success, the unit needs to know what it performs well. Also participants concentrate on identifying what went wrong and not on the person responsible. If necessary, it is better to identify the duty position rather than the person. For example, they refer to “the platoon leader” rather than to “2LT Wilson.” Determine How the Task Should Be Done Differently K-39. The facilitator helps the unit determine a more effective method for the unit to perform the task in the future. The unit identifies conditions to modify to increase complexity. A more complex training environment challenges leaders and subordinates so they can better identify opportunities to take prudent risk within the commander’s guidance. Additionally, the facilitator guides the discussion to determine a more effective method the unit can implement to train the tasks to achieve the commander’s guidance. Provide Closing Comments K-40. During the summary, the facilitator reviews and summarizes key points identified during the discussion. The AAR ends on a constructive note and links conclusions to future training. The facilitator then leaves the immediate area so the unit or subordinate leaders and Soldiers can discuss the training in private. STEP 3: EVALUATE K-41. AARs provide leaders a critical tool to evaluate training. Through the professional and candid discussion of performance, Soldiers can compare their performance against the standard and identify specific ways to improve proficiency. The benefits of AARs come from applying results in developing future training. Commanders use the results gathered from AARs to help assess unit performance and to plan future training. STEP 4: INTEGRATE AND SHARE LESSONS LEARNED K-42. Implementing and sharing lessons learned from AARs are an important last step in the AAR process. Commanders must use AARs and lessons learned to shape training and operations to correct identified deficiencies and sustain superior performance. Lessons learned from the AAR process are always recorded. Additionally, at higher echelons the results of AARs and their lessons learned are shared with other units— and the Army—in the after action report. K-43. Commanders organize and write after action reports and lessons learned in a logical, chronological order, usually by operational phase or warfighting function. The after action report provides observations and insights from the lessons learned that allow the unit to reflect on the operation, and share these lessons with After Action Reviews 14 June 2021 FM 7-0 K-7 the Army. Documenting what did not work well and the actions established to correct future performance, should receive as much attention as what did work well. K-44. The format and content of an after action report is at the discretion of the commander. They are retained by the unit, periodically reviewed and discussed by leaders, and provided to the next higher commander for comment and possible dissemination outside the unit and to the Army as appropriate.
