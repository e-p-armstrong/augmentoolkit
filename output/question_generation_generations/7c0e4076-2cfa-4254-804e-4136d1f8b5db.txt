You are an expert educational AI that, given a paragraph or two from a text, will create suitable educational questions based on the paragraphs, and *only* based on the paragraphs. You are focusing on understanding, application, analysis, and synthesis of ideas (cognitive levels). The questions you create will lean towards longer, more difficult questions that require some thought to solve — but can still be solved given the paragraphs provided. Essentially: the questions will test comprehension of real information that would be worthy to teach. After the question, you will also write its answer.

Do not explicitly mention the paragraphs in the questions themselves — just ask about the concepts related to the questions. BE CAREFUL NOT TO ASK QUESTIONS ABOUT THINGS THAT DO NOT APPEAR IN THE TEXT.

You will not mention the text explicitly in any questions you think of, since the questions you generate are intended to test people's knowledge of the information — when given the questions, they WILL NOT HAVE THE TEXT ON HAND, and so if you mention the author they won't have a clue what you're talking about.

In mathematics, the concept of a 'function' is fundamental, defining a relationship where each input is associated with exactly one output. An important class of functions is 'linear functions', represented by the equation y = mx + b, where 'm' is the slope and 'b' is the y-intercept. The slope 'm' measures the steepness and direction of the linear function, while the y-intercept 'b' indicates the point where the line crosses the y-axis. Understanding these components is crucial in graphing linear functions and solving real-world problems. Another vital concept is the 'quadratic function', typically expressed as y = ax² + bx + c. The 'a' coefficient determines the opening direction and width of the parabola, 'b' influences the axis of symmetry, and 'c' represents the y-intercept. These functions form the basis of algebra and are extensively used in various fields including physics, economics, and engineering.
"""

### Response:
## Reasoning and thought process:
Identify Key Topics: The key topics in this paragraph are linear and quadratic functions in mathematics, their definitions, components, and applications.
Brainstorm and Develop Questions Testing Recall: Formulate questions that test the recall of definitions and components of these functions. Example: "What does the 'm' in the linear function equation represent?"
Devise Questions Exploring Relationships Between Components: Generate questions that explore the relationship between different parts of the equations. Example: "How does the coefficient 'a' in a quadratic function affect its graph?"
Create Questions Investigating Vital Concepts: Make questions about key concepts from the text, without mentioning the text (this is not a literary or philosophical text). Example: "What are the formulae for linear and quadratic functions, respectively?"
Make a Question that Naturally Complements the Text's Focus: The text by Elise Delacroix focuses on linear and quadratic functions in mathematics (as well as functions in general), and another question on this subject would be suitable. The text focuses on explaining properties of linear and quadratic functions, but it also briefly defines what a function is. Since this knowledge is foundational to the other concepts, it makes sense to create a question off of it; but since the definition in the text is brief, the question will only require a brief answer. Example: "Define the concept of a function in mathematics, in one sentence."

## Questions:
1.) How does the slope 'm' in a linear function y = mx + b affect the graph of the function?
Answer: The slope 'm' in a linear function determines the steepness and direction of the line on the graph. A positive slope means the line ascends from left to right, while a negative slope indicates it descends. The steeper the slope, the more inclined or declined the line is on the graph.

2.) What role does the y-intercept 'b' play in graphing a linear function?
Answer: The y-intercept 'b' in the linear function equation y = mx + b represents the point where the line crosses the y-axis.

3.) In the equation of a quadratic function y = ax² + bx + c, how does the coefficient 'a' influence the graph of the function?
Answer: The coefficient 'a' in a quadratic function determines the opening direction and the width of the parabola.

4.) Define the concept of a function in mathematics, in one sentence.
Answer: A function is a relationship where each input is associated with exactly one output.

When Zarathustra was thirty years old, he left his home and the lake of his home, and went into the mountains. There he enjoyed his spirit and
solitude, and for ten years did not weary of it. But at last his heart changed,—and rising one morning with the rosy dawn, he went before the
sun, and spake thus unto it:

Thou great star! What would be thy happiness if thou hadst not those for
whom thou shinest!

For ten years hast thou climbed hither unto my cave: thou wouldst have
wearied of thy light and of the journey, had it not been for me, mine
eagle, and my serpent.

But we awaited thee every morning, took from thee thine overflow and
blessed thee for it.

Lo! I am weary of my wisdom, like the bee that hath gathered too much
honey; I need hands outstretched to take it.

I would fain bestow and distribute, until the wise have once more become
joyous in their folly, and the poor happy in their riches.

Therefore must I descend into the deep: as thou doest in the
evening, when thou goest behind the sea, and givest light also to the
nether-world, thou exuberant star!

Like thee must I GO DOWN, as men say, to whom I shall descend.
"""

### Response:
## Reasoning and Thought Process:
Identify Key Themes: In this excerpt, we find themes of transformation, self-discovery, the value of wisdom, and the need for recognition of effort and wisdom.
Brainstorm and Develop Questions Testing Recall: Develop questions asking for specific information mentioned in this text. I cannot mention the text — I can only refer to the general concepts, ideas, facts, or opinions expressed in this text about Zarathustra. For instance, "Finish the quote: I am weary of my wisdom, like..."
Devise Questions Testing Comprehension of, and Belief in, the Text's Opinions: Questions can be formed to check understanding and acceptance of the text's philosophy. For instance, "What do people undergoing difficult journeys or possessing wisdom need, in order to make their efforts more bearable?" Which might be answered with, "They need the acknowledgement and admiration of others." I will be careful that all lines I ask about have enough context to be answered by themselves.
Create Questions Investigating Interpretations: Given the text's rich language, I will devise questions interpreting its meaning; since this is a literary text I can mention the text, but only by name. Example: "Why did Zarathustra leave the mountains and become a man again?"
Make a Question that Naturally Complements the Text's Focus: The text about the story of Zarathustra focuses on Zarathustra's monologue, and another question on this subject would be suitable. Zarathustra compares himself and his actions to the sun throughout his monologue, such as when he relates his intention to "descend into the deep" to the sun's own going to the nether-world. A good question might ask after this crucial comparison, and could be "List one way in which Zarathustra compares himself to the sun."

## Questions:
1.) Finish the quote: I am weary of my wisdom, like...
Answer: "...the bee that hath gathered too much honey; I need hands outstretched to take it."

2.) What do people undergoing difficult journeys or possessing wisdom need, in order to make their efforts more bearable?
Answer: They need the acknowledgement and admiration of others. They need others to see and appreciate the light they bring.

3.) Why did Zarathustra leave the mountains and become a man again?
Answer: After enjoying his spirit and solitude for ten years, he had a change of heart, and realized that wisdom unshared, without acknowledgement, brings little satisfaction. He became a man and descended the mountains in order to "fain bestow and distribute, until the wise have once more become joyous in their folly, and the poor happy in their riches."

4.) List one way in which Zarathustra compares himself to the sun.
Answer: Zarathustra explains to the sun, in Thus Spake Zarathustra, that he must descend into the deep — and he compares this action to the sun's own going "behind the sea" where it gives light to the "nether-world".

I went down yesterday to the Piraeus with Glaucon the son of Ariston,
that I might offer up my prayers to the goddess (Bendis, the Thracian
Artemis.); and also because I wanted to see in what manner they would
celebrate the festival, which was a new thing. I was delighted with the
procession of the inhabitants; but that of the Thracians was equally,
if not more, beautiful. When we had finished our prayers and viewed the
spectacle, we turned in the direction of the city; and at that instant
Polemarchus the son of Cephalus chanced to catch sight of us from a
distance as we were starting on our way home, and told his servant to
run and bid us wait for him. The servant took hold of me by the cloak
behind, and said: Polemarchus desires you to wait.

I turned round, and asked him where his master was.

There he is, said the youth, coming after you, if you will only wait.

Certainly we will, said Glaucon; and in a few minutes Polemarchus
appeared, and with him Adeimantus, Glaucon’s brother, Niceratus the son
of Nicias, and several others who had been at the procession.

Polemarchus said to me: I perceive, Socrates, that you and your
companion are already on your way to the city.

You are not far wrong, I said.

But do you see, he rejoined, how many we are?

Of course.

And are you stronger than all these? for if not, you will have to
remain where you are.

May there not be the alternative, I said, that we may persuade you to
let us go?

But can you persuade us, if we refuse to listen to you? he said.

Certainly not, replied Glaucon.

Then we are not going to listen; of that you may be assured.

### Response:
## Reasoning and Thought Process:
Identify Key Themes: This excerpt presents themes of social interaction, philosophical dialogue, and the dynamics of persuasion and power.
Brainstorm and Develop Questions Testing Recall: Instead of focusing on dry, context-dependent questions like the order of events or family relations, I will concentrate on more meaningful historical details present in the text. I cannot mention the text — I can only refer to the general concepts, ideas, facts, or opinions expressed in this text about a scene in ancient Greece. For instance, "Which goddess is Bendis equivalent to?"
Devise Questions Exploring Comprehension of, and Belief in, the Text's Opinions: I will create questions that delve into the mind and thoughts of the writer. For example, drawing on the contentious interaction between Polemarchus and Socrates, I could ask, "If someone indicates that they will force you to take a course of action, using physical force, what is an alternative you can take?" with the answer being "Persuade them to let me go." This question encourages the reader to put themselves in the mind of the author.
Create Questions Investigating Interpretations: Focusing on the dialogue's subtleties, I will craft an interpretative question. Since this is a literary text, I can reference the text, but only by name. So the question might be, "If someone comments on the size of their group and questions your strength compared to it, ultimately stating that you will have to remain where you are, what is that person implying?" This question prompts critical thinking about power dynamics and conversational implications depicted.
Make a Question that Naturally Complements the Text's Focus: The text about a Socrates' visit to Piraeus in ancient Greece focuses on the visit to Piraeus and the interaction with Glaucon, and another question on this subject would be suitable. The text focuses on the interaction between Polemarchus and Socrates, but enough questions have already been asked about that subject to cover it completely. That leaves the visit to Piraeus as a subject for questions. The cause behind Socrates' visit to Piraeus is directly mentioned in the text and could make for a good recall question, so one question may be "Why did Socrates visit Piraeus with Glaucon?"

## Questions:
1.) Which goddess is Bendis equivalent to?
Answer: The Thracian Goddess Bendis is equivalent to Artemis.

2.) If someone indicates that they will force you to take a course of action, using physical force, what is an alternative you can take?
Answer: One viable alternative I can take is to persuade them to let me go. This, of course, requires that the other party does not refuse to listen to me.

3.) If someone comments on the size of their group and questions your strength compared to it, ultimately stating that you will have to remain where you are, what is that person implying?
Answer: That person is implying that since their group is stronger than you, they can force you to remain where you are.

4.) Why did Socrates visit Piraeus with Glaucon?
Answer: Socrates visited Piraeus to offer up his prayers to the goddess Bendis, as well as to see in what manner the Thracians would celebrate the festival.

During the construction of the Panama Canal, a massive engineering feat completed in 1914, several challenges and achievements were noted. The canal, spanning approximately 50 miles, was designed to shorten the maritime route between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. Notably, the construction saw the use of innovative excavation techniques, with over 200 million cubic yards of earth removed. The project also faced significant health challenges, including combating malaria and yellow fever, which were overcome through extensive public health measures. The completion of the canal significantly impacted global trade, reducing the sea voyage from San Francisco to New York by around 8,000 miles.

## Reasoning and Thought Process:
Identify Key Topics: The paragraph details specific aspects of the Panama Canal's construction, focusing on its challenges, innovations, and impacts. Topics include construction challenges, health issues, excavation techniques, and the canal's impact on global trade.
Brainstorm and Develop Questions Testing Recall: Questions can be formed to recall factual data from the text. I cannot mention the text — I can only refer to the general concepts, ideas, facts, or opinions expressed in this text about the Panama Canal. Example: "How much earth was excavated during the construction of the Panama Canal?"
Devise Questions Exploring Cause and Effect Relationships: This involves creating questions that explore how certain challenges led to specific solutions and impacts. Example: "What health challenges were faced during the construction of the Panama Canal, and how were they overcome?"
Create Questions Investigating Quantitative Values: Given the text's focus on concrete numbers, I will devise questions that require analyzing these figures. Example: "By how many miles did the Panama Canal reduce the sea voyage from San Francisco to New York?"
Make a Question that Naturally Complements the Text's Focus: The text about the history of the Panama Canal's construction focuses on the Panama Canal (and recall-oriented facts about it), and another question on this subject would be suitable.

### Response:
## Reasoning and thought process:
Identify Key Topics: The key topic in this paragraph is the scale of the solar system, which is presented using analogy to make the distances easier to conceive of.
Brainstorm and Develop Questions Testing Recall: Formulate questions that test the recall of the components of this analogy. Since the text is not provided while the question is being asked, I will have to include the analogy in the question. Example: "If the Earth had a diameter of only one inch, how far would the moon be from the Earth, if it (and its distance from the Earth) were also resized proportionally?"
Devise Questions Exploring Relationships Between Components: Generate questions that explore the relationship between different information in the excerpt. Notably, in this text the distances between planets are much greater than the planets' sizes. Example question: "How do the distances between planets compare to their sizes?"
Create Questions Investigating Vital Concepts: Make questions about key concepts from the text, without mentioning the text (this is not a literary or philosophical text). A key concept is the distances between planets. Since the paragraph relies on an analogy, which the reader of the question will not have access to, I will have to provide this context. Example: "If you scaled everything down so that the Earth had a diameter of one inch, then how far would Mercury and Venus be from the sun?"
Make a Question that Naturally Complements the Text's Focus: The text about the size of objects in the solar system focuses on the size-based analogy described throughout, and another question on this subject would be suitable. Another question could simply ask about information that's already been tested, but for a different planet that is also mentioned in the text. Being mindful that the reader of the text will not have access to the source text, I will provide the analogy as context, as I ask the question: "If the earth had a diameter of only one inch, how far would Mars be from the earth, if it (and its distance from the earth) were also resized proportionally?"

## Questions:
1.) If the earth had a diameter of only one inch, how far would the moon be from the earth, if it (and its distance from the earth) were also resized proportionally?
Answer: The moon would be two feet and a half from the earth. The moon's size, under this new scale, would be that of a small pea.

2.) How do the distances between planets compare to their sizes?
Answer: The distances between planets is much greater than the planets' sizes. If you shrunk everything down so that the Earth was one inch in diameter, then the sun would be 323 yards away.

3.) If you scaled everything down so that the earth had a diameter of one inch, then how far would Mercury and Venus be from the sun?
Answer: Mercury would be one hundred and twenty-five yards from the sun, and Venus would be two hundred and fifty yards from the sun.

4.) If the earth had a diameter of only one inch, how far would Mars be from the earth, if it (and its distance from the earth) were also resized proportionally?
Answer: Mars would be a hundred and seventy-five feet beyond the earth.

(b) Among the potential citizen-saboteurs who are to engage in physical destruction, two extreme types may be distinguished. On the one hand, there is the man who is not technically trained and employed. This man needs specific suggestions as to what he can and should destroy as well as details regarding the tools by means of which destruction is accomplished. (c) At the other extreme is the man who is a technician, such as a lathe operator or an automobile mechanic. Presumably this man would be able to devise methods of simple sabotage which would be appropriate to his own facilities. However, this man needs to be stimulated to re-orient his thinking in the direction of destruction. Specific examples, which need not be from his own field, should accomplish this.
