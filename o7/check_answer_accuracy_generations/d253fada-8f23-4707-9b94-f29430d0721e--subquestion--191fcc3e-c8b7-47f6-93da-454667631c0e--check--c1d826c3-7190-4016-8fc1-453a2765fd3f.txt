    which they cut through or suppressed might be neglected--was that in time, with
    the modern rapidity of communication and the power of the modern State, these

    which governed them. But experience has falsified this very reasonable conception.
    It has been found not only that this transformation did not take place, but even
    that the old real nationalities were actually getting stronger. Poland, for instance,
    artificially cut through by the German, Austrian, and Russian frontiers, did seem
    for a time as though it were going to spring into a Russian, a German, and an
    Austrian type of Polish men; and in the latter case, that of Austria, some considerable
    advance was made towards such a result. But generations passed, and the process
    did not continue; on the contrary, the tide began to set backwards, and the conception
    of a united Poland is far stronger to-day even in the small and successful Austrian
    portion of Poland than it was thirty years ago.In the face of these two postulates,
