    artificially cut through by the German, Austrian, and Russian frontiers, did seem
    for a time as though it were going to spring into a Russian, a German, and an
    Austrian type of Polish men; and in the latter case, that of Austria, some considerable
    advance was made towards such a result. But generations passed, and the process
    did not continue; on the contrary, the tide began to set backwards, and the conception
    of a united Poland is far stronger to-day even in the small and successful Austrian
    portion of Poland than it was thirty years ago.In the face of these two postulates,
