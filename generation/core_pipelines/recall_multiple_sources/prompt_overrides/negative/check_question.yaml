  content: | # I KNOW WHAT I AM GOING TO USE THIS FOR: CHECK IF THE QUESTION IS ANSWERABLE OR CORRECTABLE, GIVEN THE TEXT. SEE FINAL EX IN REPAIR CONTEXT FOR REFERENCE ||| TODO 
    You are an expert educational AI. Given a paragraph or two from a larger text, and a question based on the paragraphs, you will make a determination as to whether the question tests ONLY information in the paragraphs. Essentially: you will check if the question is answerable, given the information in the paragraphs. Your task includes first analyzing the text, thinking through whether or not the question reflects aspects of the paragraphs provided.

    The specific questions you are analyzing are adversarial -- they are inconsistent with the information in the text, and the answer's job is to correct the question and then provide an adequate answer based off of the provided information. You are therefore checking IF the questions CONTRADICT something about the provided information (or if they contradict common sense).
    
    Following your analysis, at the very end of your response — in your "final judgment" or "final answer" — you will write "RELEVANT" or "IRRELEVANT" depending on your analysis of the question with regards to the text.
    
    Note a special exception: if a question includes information that isn't in the paragraphs, but is clearly (DIRECTLY, not implicitly or implied) mentioned by the paragraphs as having been covered earlier, then that question is relevant. Essentially: questions are allowed to cover content that the text has explicitly covered in the past.
    
    **So in summary:**

    * You will analyze the question step-by-step, ensuring each part of the question is individually compared to the text.
    * The key steps are:
      * analyzing the text
      * understanding the (flawed) question
      * systematically comparing each part of the question with the text
      * determining whether this adversarial question is related to the text
    * The deliberately-flawed question must have an actual flaw to be relevant -- it can't just be flawed because it asks about something the text doesn't cover. If the question makes sense, even with the information provided, but can't be answered because the information provided does not include the relevant information, then it's irrelevant.
    * This process continues until either a part of the question is found not to be covered by the text, leading to a judgment of "IRRELEVANT," or until all parts of the question have been compared and found to be covered by the text, leading to a judgment of "RELEVANT."
    * This method allows for a thorough and detailed assessment, ensuring that the final judgment accurately reflects the extent to which the question is based on the given text.
    * Keep in mind that the provided text snippet may cut off abruptly. Work around this.
    
    Please now apply this method to the provided text and question, and write out your reasoning and thought process.

    # error while loading shared libraries: libgomp.so.1: No such file or directory
    # error while loading shared libraries: libz.so: No such file or directory

    When running `./verusd` on a Linux distro (eg Debian or Devuan), not all dependencies may be installed by default, resulting in the errormessage `error while loading shared libraries: libgomp.so.1: No such file or directory` or `error while loading shared libraries: libz.so: No such file or directory`.

    To solve this you need to install the libgomp and zlib1g-dev libraries:
    `sudo apt-get install libgomp1 zlib1g-dev`

    """
    `libgomp.so.1` and `libz.so` are not the libraries you need — you need the libgomp and zlib1g-dev libraries. Installing these will fix your error. You can accomplish this by running `sudo apt-get install libgomp1 zlib1g-dev`.

    ## Reasoning and thought process:
    
    ### In-Depth Analysis of the Text:
    #### Content and Depth: The text details a solution to a dependency issue that may come up when running `./verusd` on a Linux distribution. It describes that the libraries `libgomp1` and `zlib1g-dev` may not be installed by default, and provides a `sudo apt-get install` command to install them.
    #### Type of Information: The information is tailored to solving a problem, first outlining a problem and then its solution.
    
    ### Detailed Understanding of the Question:
    #### Core Requirement: The question asks about how to install the libgomp.so.1 and libz.so libraries.
    #### Type of Purposeful Error: The question asserts something that contradicts the provided information (it is not the libgomp.so.1 and libz.so libraries that must be installed, but the `libgomp` and `zlib1g-dev` libraries).
    #### Information Needed to Correct It and Answer: The question needs to be corrected with the actual libraries whose absence causes the error. The question needs to be answered with a command to install the actual libraries.
    
    ### Targeted Comparison of the Question with the Text:
    #### Content Match: The text contains the names of the libraries that need to be installed, as well as the command for installing them.
    #### Depth Match: Since only the names and a command for installing these libaries is needed, the provided information is sufficiently deep to correct and answer the question.
    
    ### Critical Evaluation and Final Judgment:
    The text contains enough information to correct, and then answer, the question with sufficient detail. This makes it: RELEVANT.

    # What versions of OSX/macOS are supported?
    
    ## Verus Desktop
    
    Currently only macOS 10.12.x and up are tested and supported for Verus Desktop. Installing Verus Desktop on OSX 10.11.x or earlier may be possible but the wallet does not function and never completes the initial sync.
    
    ## Verus CLI wallet
    
    The CLI wallet should run on lower versions without problems.
    
    ## File location
    
    `VRSC Wallet and Data location` on Mac OS: `/Users//Library/Application Support/Komodo/VRSC`
    
    ### Necessary files:
    
    Link 1: [How-To install the latest Wallet](#!/how-to/how-to_bootstrap.md)
    
    ## Procedure:
    
    If you installed on OSX 10.11.x or earlier and need to remove it:
    
    1. Quit your Wallet.
    2. Eject the wallet dmg.
    3. Make a backup of `wallet.dat` & `VRSC.conf` if necessary (Only if you had a wallet on this machine or if you used an existing `wallet.dat`)
    4. If you installed the `Agama.app` in Applications, move this to the trash.
    5. Move `~/Library/Application Support/Agama` to the trash or use the following command in terminal
    `rmdir /Users//Library/Application\\ Support/Agama`.
    6. Move `~/Library/Application Support/Komodo` to the trash or use the following command in terminal
    `rmdir /Users//Library/Application\\ Support/Komodo`.
    7. Upgrade OS.
    8. Install Agama (Check `Link1` for a smooth install)

    ## Reasoning and thought process:
    
    ### In-Depth Analysis of the Text:
    #### Content and Depth: The text is part of an FAQ about the Verus Desktop and Verus Wallet. It describes the required versions for Verus Desktop, the locations of the VRSC wallet and Data on Mac OS, and details a procedure for deletion on OSX 10.11.x.
    #### Type of Information: The information is comprised of short and factual answers to common questions, thoug the Procedure section also demonstrates how to perform a task.
    
    ### Detailed Understanding of the Question:
    #### Core Requirement: The question asks about where the wallet and data files are located on a Windows PC.
    ### Type of Purposeful Error: The question asks about something that is not mentioned in the provided information. However, the question is still a valid question, it just isn't answerable with the provided information (it asks about something that does exist, but is not mentioned by the provided information. Therefore, it has the rong kind of flaw, and should be rejected).
    #### Information Needed to Correct It and Answer: The question is valid so does not need correction. The question needs to be answered with the location of the wallet and data files on a Windows PC.
    
    ### Targeted Comparison of the Question with the Text:
    #### Content Match: The text contains the location of the wallet and data files on Mac OS, but not on Windows.
    #### Depth Match: Since only the location of the wallet and data on Mac, not Windows, is provided, this question cannot be answered with the information in the text. Further, it is the wrong kind of flawed: it asks about something which *does* actually exist, but is just not present in the text. For it to be right, it should have asked about something that clearly did not exist, or asserted something that contradicts the provided information.
    
    ### Critical Evaluation and Final Judgment:
    The text does not contain the information needed to answer the question, and the question is the wrong kind of flawed. This makes it: IRRELEVANT.
